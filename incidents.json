Groundwater is high, within a metre of the surface at East Dean, and rising 10cm each day. 15-30mm of rain is forecast Thursday afternoon 07/12/2023. From 09/12/2023 minor groundwater flood impacts are possible, with springs appearing, water flowing on roads, water in basements or under floorboards, and affecting the ability of the sewage network to operate in East Dean, Charlton, Singleton and West Dean. A further 20mm of rain is possible Saturday 09/12/2023. Only small amounts of rain are currently forecast Friday, Sunday and next week. Groundwater is expected to continue rising until 15/12/2023 at Chilgrove and until the New Year at East Dean. If the second half of December is dry, groundwater flood impacts might ease in January. However, groundwater will remain higher than normal and sensitive to any additional rainfall over winter. If you have pumps to help reduce groundwater levels in your property, ensure they are operational. We continue to monitor the levels and forecast. We will update this message by 18:00 13/12/2023.",
