All times are local and refer to the high water times at Chiswell, mAOD is height above average sea level and for more detail please refer to local tide tables. Flooding to roads and farmland is possible at these times, however conditions may apply two to four hours either side of the high tide. We expect flooding to affect Lyme Regis, Charmouth, Seatown, West Bay, Bothenhampton, Burton Freshwater, Burton Bradstock, Cogdean Beach, Chesil Beach, West Fleet, East Fleet and Chiswell.   Please be careful along beaches, promenades and coastal footpaths and roads.
