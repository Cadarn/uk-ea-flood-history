However we do not expect to be issuing flood warnings, and with a drier outlook overnight and tomorrow, levels should fall below flood alert levels over the following 24 hours.\nWe are monitoring rainfall and river levels and are checking rivers for blockages in the area.\nAvoid using low lying footpaths and any bridges near local watercourses and do not attempt to walk or drive through flood water.\nThis message will be updated by 10:00 AM on Friday 23/09/2022, or as the situation changes.",
