River levels could rise by a few centimetres in Pulborough Friday, as a result of Friday morning's tide. However, river levels should fall again Friday evening. Very little rain is forecast Friday and Saturday, but the river will not return to a normal level until next week. Flooding of fields will continue until the weekend.
