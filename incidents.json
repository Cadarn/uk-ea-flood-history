It is currently unclear which areas will experience the heaviest rain.\n\nIf the heaviest rain affects the Waltham Forest, Waltham Abbey, Waltham Cross, Barnet, Nazeing, Enfield, Chingford, Edmonton, Cheshunt or Tottenham areas, there is the possibility that rivers could overtop their banks. Flooding to low lying land, roads and gardens is possible from Saturday morning. Flooding from surface water could also occur.\n\nWe expect river levels to respond by rising quickly in areas receiving the heaviest rain. We recommend you stay aware of local weather conditions and water levels. Consider putting your flood plan into action. You should avoid walking, cycling or driving through flood water.\n\nWe expect the band of rain to move out of the area on Saturday evening, scattered showers are forecast for Sunday.

It is currently unclear which areas will experience the heaviest rain.\n\nIf the heaviest rain affects the Harrow or Hillingdon areas there is the possibility that rivers could overtop their banks. Flooding to low lying land, roads and riverside gardens is possible from Saturday morning. Flooding from surface water, where water gathers and flows off road surfaces, could also occur.\n\nWe expect river levels to respond by rising quickly in areas receiving the heaviest rain. We recommend you stay aware of local weather conditions and water levels. Consider putting your flood plan into action. You should avoid walking, cycling or driving through flood water.\n\nWe expect the band of rain to move out of the area on Saturday evening, scattered showers are forecast for Sunday. We are constantly monitoring rainfall and river levels and are checking rivers for blockages.\n\nWe will update this message on Saturday afternoon or earlier if the situation changes.",
