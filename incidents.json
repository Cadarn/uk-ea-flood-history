Consequently, flooding is expected to continue to affect low lying areas bordering the shores of Derwentwater and the lake frontage of the Keswick Camping and Caravan Club Site today, Thursday 17/02/2022. Flooding of properties is not expected though the campsite itself remains closed. Todayâ€™s forecast is largely dry and we expect the level of Derwentwater to continue to fall. However, levels are expected to rise again in response to further rain associated with Storm Eunice, which is forecast to start in the early hours of Friday and continue through the day. We are closely monitoring the situation. Please avoid using low lying footpaths near Derwentwater and local watercourses, which may be flooded and avoid driving through floodwater. This message will be updated tomorrow, or as the situation changes.",

High water levels may last for a few days, until the high tides at Great Yarmouth have passed. This is due to a natural tide locking effect. High tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth, is currently restricting the normal drainage out to sea at low tide, of the Broads river system. We expect to see high water levels in Brundall and Reedham riverside areas. There is also a heightened risk from overtopping at Haddiscoe New Cut.
