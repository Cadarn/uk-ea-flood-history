Forecasts indicate further unsettled weather and rainfall is possible from Wednesday 21st February onwards, and we expect rivers to remain high throughout the next few days and flooding to gardens, driveways or outhouses is possible close to rivers.  Our forecasts indicate that flooding inside properties isn't likely and therefore flood warnings are not expected to be issued. We are constantly monitoring river levels and have staff in the field checking for blockages and clearing weedscreens. Please avoid using low lying footpaths near local watercourses and plan driving routes to avoid low lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded.
