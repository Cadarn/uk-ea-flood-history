Athelney spillway stopped running on Saturday, although the water level in Currymoor remains close to the spillway height.

The current forecast for the next 5 days shows no rain. We expect river levels to fall and pumping operations to continue during this period. The situation across the moors is being continually monitored. River Parrett levels are being managed with the Sowy relief channel, in order to assist Currymoor, Northmoor and Saltmoor pumping.
