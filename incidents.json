This is causing the River Avon to rise and the river is forecast to continue rising throughout Tuesday night and into the early hours of Wednesday morning.\n\nProperties and low lying areas in South Brent, Avonwick and Aveton Gifford will start to flood first.\n\nFlood waters may be deep and fast flowing in these areas. Residents are strongly urged to take action now. Remain safe and be aware of your local surroundings.\n\nWe will be closely monitoring river levels throughout Tuesday night. This message will be updated on Wednesday morning, or as the situation changes. \n",
