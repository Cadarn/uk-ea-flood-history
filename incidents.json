      "message": "Water levels in the Eastern Yar are near their normal levels and there is little risk of flooding in the immediate future. However, the river’s base flow is now a little higher since the recent exceptional rainfall. At Alverstone the level is only slowly receding but is unlikely to cause property flooding. At Sandown levels continue to fall allowing low lying flood affected land, ditches, cycle tracks and access paths to drain along the lower Yar Valley. Golf Links and Moreton Common Road will be clear of flooding. Today’s forecast has a low likelihood for some heavy showers this afternoon. Most places will see little rainfall totals but a few isolated locations could experience up to 20 to 30mm in a short time. This will continue into Monday and Tuesday. The river will be sensitive to significant rainfall and further rain may cause some surface water ponding or briefly increase river levels but should not cause out of bank flooding. We will monitor the weather and reissue an alert if the forecast changes.",
