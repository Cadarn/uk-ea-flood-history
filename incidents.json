      "message": "With Storm Isha tonight bad weather will affect the West Bay area.  Very strong winds and large waves could overtop sea defences with sea spray and the tidal surge will help to increase the water levels.   \nThe forecast high water is between 00:30 AM and 04:00 AM on the 22nd January with a total water level of 6.2m AOD for West Bay and a Force 9 south westerley wind.  All times are local and for more detail please refer to your local tide tables.  \nFlooding to roads and farmland is possible at these times, however conditions may apply two to four hours either side of the high tide. We expect properties situated behind East Beach, including Pier Terrace, Waterside, The Bay House, The Old Watch House, Bridport Arms Hotel, Seagulls, Swains Row, The Old Timber Yard, Station Road, Station Way and George Street to be affected.  \nPlease be careful along beaches, promenades and coastal footpaths and roads.  We will be  closely monitoring the situation and this message will be updated by 13:00 on Monday 22/01/24, or as the situation changes.  \n",
