The winterbourne has been flowing in Meonstoke for several weeks and there is a small amount of water ponded around the electricity sub-station in Rectory Lane. The weather from today (13/12/2023) until Sunday (17/12/2023) is forecast to be dry. At our borehole at Pound Lane, the groundwater level will stabilise by Friday 15/12/2023, before beginning to slowly fall. Long range forecasting is difficult, but there is currently an indication that unsettled weather will return to Hampshire from the end of next week. If heavy rain affects the Meon Valley, groundwater levels will rise again, and water will begin flowing across Rectory Lane. We continue to monitor the forecast. If you use pumps to help reduce water levels, please ensure that they can operate. This Flood Alert will be updated by 17:00 on Tuesday 19/12/2023.",
