Water levels continue to remain high. This is due to a natural tide locking effect. High tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth, is currently restricting the normal drainage out to sea at low tide, of the Broads river system. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boat yards and Ferry road in Horning. Be ready to take action to protect your property, if flooding is expected. We are monitoring the situation and are not expecting the situation to escalate. We will update this message by 10am tomorrow, Saturday 4th December 2021.\t\n",
