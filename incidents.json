Flooding remains possible in locations near the River Derwent, with low lying land expected to be most affected, particularly around local roads and low-lying land around Buttercrambe, Stamford Bridge, Pocklington, Wressle, Wilberfoss and Elvington through the weekend. No further significant rainfall is forecast today, but river levels will remain high over the weekend. We are monitoring rainfall and river levels and are checking rivers for blockages in the area. Avoid using low lying footpaths and any bridges near local watercourses and do not attempt to walk or drive through flood water. This message will be updated by 09:00 PM on 19/11/2022, or as the situation changes.",
