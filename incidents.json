Minor groundwater flood impacts are expected to continue, affecting the ability of the sewage network to operate in East Dean, Charlton, Singleton and West Dean. Water will affect some basements, and be underneath ground floors. Water will affect roads, including the B2141 near Chilgrove. Very little rain is forecast Friday, Saturday and Sunday 31/03/2024. There is uncertainty. Even if rain reaches Sussex, from the continent on Monday 01/04/2024, groundwater is unlikely to rise far. Despite the unsettled weather potentially continuing through to mid April, groundwater will probably keep slowly falling. Groundwater will remain close to the surface.

Currently (Thursday 28/03/2024) there is a significant amount of water flooding land and fields from Timsbury to Romsey. Some footpath flooding may affect Rivermead Close and the Memorial Park. At Romsey Industrial estate, water may be ponded on land near to Greatbridge Road.  Land at Broadlands and Testwood will also flood. Heavy showers will continue to affect the area over the next 24 hours with up to 30mm possible and flood impacts may increase throughout this period. Conditions remain unsettled into the weekend although less rain is forecast after Friday 29/03/2024. While water levels in the river will begin to reduce, they will remain higher than normal over the next few weeks. We are managing sluices to balance water levels through the town.

This means that the River Ise and tributaries are now rising, which will lead to flooding of low-lying land and roads close to the river from the morning of Friday 29th March onwards. We expect the river to remain high throughout the next few days and flooding to gardens, driveways or outhouses is possible close to the river. Our forecasts indicate that flooding inside properties isn't likely and therefore flood warnings are not expected to be issued.
