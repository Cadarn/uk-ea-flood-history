      "message": "Groundwater levels are high, but falling slowly, at our two boreholes in Piddington and Ray Farm in the High Wycombe area. Groundwater levels are above normal for this time of year and communities may continue to be affected by groundwater flooding as the catchment remains sensitive to further rainfall due to saturated ground and high groundwater levels. The weather forecast is for isolated showers today, some of which could be heavy. Saturday and Sunday are forecast to be dry with further unsettled weather expected next week. Low-lying land, gardens, roads, and cellars will therefore continue to be at risk of flooding. Due to the nature of groundwater flooding, this situation could continue for several weeks or longer. Avoid driving or walking through floodwater as there may be concealed hazards. We are continuing to monitor groundwater levels and will update this message by Friday, 07/06/2024, or as the situation changes. ",
