Golf Links Road and Moreton Common Road are flooded. Levels will be high at Sandown Bridge, the sewage treatment plant and Fort Holiday Park. A further 10mm of rain is forecast for the remainder of today and overnight. Levels at Alverstone will rise again. Be prepared for the river to be higher than normal for the next few days.
