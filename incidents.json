Tuesday and Wednesday 06/12/2023 are forecast to be largely dry, which will allow river levels to continue to fall. River levels at Lodsbridge should be nearer to normal by Wednesday. In Fittleworth, river levels will remain high all week. Thursday is predicted to be wet. The river will rise again. Current forecasts are of between 10 and 40mm of rain. The lower amount will cause minor flood impacts. If we receive the higher rainfall amount property flooding could be possible all along the Western Rother. Early actions to reduce potential impacts at Lodsbridge and Fittleworth are encouraged. We continue to monitor the levels and forecast. We will update this message by 20:00 05/12/2023.",

      "message": "Over the last 48 hours we have seen heavy rainfall in the Lower Welland area. This means that the River Welland is now rising, leading to flooding of low-lying land and roads close to the river from the afternoon of Tuesday, 5th December onwards. We expect the river to remain high throughout the next few days and flooding to gardens, driveways or outhouses is possible close to the river. Our forecasts indicate that flooding inside properties isn't likely and therefore flood warnings are not expected to be issued. We are constantly monitoring river levels and have staff in the field checking for blockages and clearing weedscreens. Please avoid using low lying footpaths near local watercourses and plan driving routes to avoid low lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded.
