With the rain that has already fallen, groundwater levels in the valley are expected to continue to rise throughout this week. If very heavy rain does affect the area, surface water impacts to properties and roads are possible from the weekend (Saturday 14/01/2023), and groundwater may affect more cellars and the sewage network. With additional unsettled weather forecast for the rest of January, levels are likely to remain high or may rise even further in the coming weeks. We are liaising with the local Flood Action Group.

If heavy rain does affect the area, it is possible that cellars in properties on West Street and East Street could begin to flood from Saturday 14/01/2022. With additional unsettled weather forecast for the rest of January, levels are likely to remain high or could rise even further in the coming weeks. We are liaising with the Flood Action Group.
