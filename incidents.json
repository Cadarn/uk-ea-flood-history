The first forecast high water is at 09:30 PM on 06/04/2022, with a level of 4.82m AODN with westerly force 7 winds. The second forecast high water is at 10:00 AM on 07/04/2022 with a level of 4.25m AODN with westerly force 7 winds. (mAODN is height above average sea level - for more info refer to local tide tables.)\nPlease be careful along beaches, promenades, coastal footpaths and roads as large waves and sea spray could be dangerous.\nAfter these tidesâ€š the weather is more settled and no further impacts are expected.\nWe will continue to monitor the forecast and expect to be able to remove this message by 12:00 PM on 07/04/2022.",
