No rain is currently forecast in the week ahead. Settled weather could continue until 23/01/2023. However, groundwater will continue to rise and groundwater flood impacts will likely increase over the coming week, maybe the next fortnight.

With groundwater now so high, and little capacity in the soil, the next time it rains, even more water could flow along the roads. We will continue to monitor levels and forecasts.
