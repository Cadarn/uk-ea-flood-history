During this time, the level at Oakley has risen by 46cm. Groundwater will be affecting the ability of septic tanks to operate properly. In Deane, cellar flooding is expected to be ongoing. From today 03/02/2025 until Friday 07/02/2025, only minimal rainfall is forecast. Groundwater levels in Deane and Ashe are expected to continue rising slowly throughout most of February in response to rainfall recorded in January. It is possible that the access road from the B3400 into Deane (at Deane Park) will need to be closed in around 2 weeks. We continue to monitor the forecast. If you have pumps to help reduce water levels, please ensure that they are operating. We will update this Flood Alert by 18:00 on Monday 10/02/2025.",
