Minor groundwater flood impacts are expected to continue to affect a small number of basements. Previous events suggest impacts may initially affect Old London Road, Patcham and Peacock Lane, Withdean. Very little rainfall is forecast for the next 5 days, although it could be possible for offshore rain on Wednesday (17/01/2024) to reach land. Groundwater is expected to continue to fall at the Ladies Mile borehole this week, and flood impacts should reduce a little. However, unsettled weather and rain looks probable from the weekend, which could cause groundwater to rise again. Groundwater will remain higher than normal and sensitive to any additional rainfall over winter. If you have pumps to help reduce groundwater levels in your property, please ensure they are operational.
