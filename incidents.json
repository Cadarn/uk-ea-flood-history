Levels on the Rivers Looe and Seaton are expected to rise.  \n\nAnticipated levels suggest that there will be flooding to low lying land and roads close to the rivers. We expect the rivers to remain high throughout Monday. \n\nThe main areas of concern include Seaton Car Park and the Seaton Valley Nature Reserve. \n\nTake care near the areas of concern and monitor your local weather conditions.   \n\nWe are monitoring river levels and have staff in the area checking for and clearing blockages.  \n\nThis message will be updated on Monday morning or earlier if the situation changes.
