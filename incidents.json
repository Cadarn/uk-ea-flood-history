Levels continued to increase through most of February and early March in response to heavy rainfall and storm events. The Caterham Bourne between Woldingham and Purley is close to flowing. Properties with deep basements and low lying land in and around Purley and the Caterham Bourne may experience flooding. Riparian owners are reminded to keep clear the sections of river that flow through their land. Flooding of properties, gardens and low lying land elsewhere is not expected at this point in time. \n\nThe Environment Agency is monitoring the situation alongside Surrey County Council, Tandridge District Council and the London Borough of Croydon.
