At West Tytherley, the level is currently stable, very close to where we expect septic tanks to struggle to operate, and cellar, land and road flooding to occur in central West Tytherley. From today (03/03/2025) until Friday (07/03/2025), the weather is expected to be dry. Groundwater levels in all villages are expected to rise during this week in response to rain recorded towards the end of February. In Nether Wallop, it is possible that cellar flooding to a small number of properties could occur towards the end of the week. In Over Wallop, land and gardens may experience minor ponding of water and the river may come out of bank at Broughton. We continue to monitor the forecast. If you use pumps to help reduce water levels, please ensure that they can operate. This Flood Alert will be updated by 18:00 on Monday 10/03/2025.",

The groundwater level at the Clarendon borehole remains high. There is no rainfall predicted for the next 2 days with small totals possible from Thursday 6th March into the weekend.  We are not currently expecting very much drop in the groundwater levels. Residents are advised to prepare property resilience measures and ensure that pumps are working where they have been installed. Residents may experience inundation of septic tanks and sewer systems. Properties may experience flooding in cellars in affected areas. Flooding of roads is expected, take particular care when driving, both for your own safety and to prevent flooding to others. Roads may have become damaged by floodwater. Where groundwater is near the surface, intense rainfall will lead to surface water flooding. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.
