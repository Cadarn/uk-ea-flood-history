The weather increases tide table values by 0.24 m. The total forecast tide is 5.06 metres Chart Datum (2.32 mAOD) at Chichester Harbour. For 1 hour either side of high water, the tide will flood Shore Road. At Bosham High Street, water could be near to or flood front door steps. Around Chichester harbour, some gardens or land at shore side properties could also be affected. Strong winds will continue until Thursday. However, wave heights, tide levels and flood impacts and risk should reduce from Wednesday afternoon. We continue to monitor the forecast. If you have them, please install flood boards 1 hour before high tide. Avoid walking through flood water as it may contain hidden hazards and be deep in places.
