We expect flooding to affect Low lying land and roads adjacent to the River Lugg south of Leominster from Stoke Prior to Mordiford. Other locations that may be affected include Bodenham, Lugwardine and Hampton Bishop. No further rainfall is forecast. We expect river levels to remain high until Tuesday evening 15/03/22. We are closely monitoring the situation. Our incident response staff are checking defences. Please avoid using low lying footpaths near local watercourses. This message will be updated this evening 15/03/22 by 6:00 pm, or as the situation changes.",
