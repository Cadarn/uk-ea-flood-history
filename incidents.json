Minor flooding will affect fields, rural roads, gardens and from 23:00 Saturday (07/08/2021) water could approach properties at Lodsbridge, near Selham and properties near Fittleworth Mill. In Liss, Iping, Stedham and near Lickfold and Halfway Bridges on the Lod, flooding is not currently expected. Instead the river should fall in these locations. Fast moving showers will only bring a small amount of rain Saturday evening (less than 5mm). However, a band of rain forecast from 08:00 Sunday morning could bring another 20mm of rain, which would cause river levels all along the Western Rother to rise again and could mean any minor flood impacts between Midhurst and Fittleworth remain throughout Sunday. Early actions to reduce potential impacts at Lodsbridge and Fittleworth are encouraged. We continue to monitor the levels and forecast. We will update this message by 09:00 08/08/2021.",
