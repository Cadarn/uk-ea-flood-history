River levels are expected to rise as a result and flooding is possible.\n\nRiver levels will potentially peak through Leeds on Sunday morning, where flooding is possible. There may be surface water flooding affecting low spots on local roads in areas affected by the heaviest rain. Further rainfall is expected on Sunday 24 November, which is likely to keep rivers high, with additional impacts possible. The most affected areas will be low lying land around the River Aire, particularly from Stockbridge to Castleford, including Bradford Beck, Oulton Beck and Kippax Beck.\n\nWe are closely monitoring the situation and our Area Incident Room will be open this weekend. Take care and avoid walking, cycling or driving through flood water or walking near swollen rivers, particularly on Saturday when gale force winds are forecast.\n\nThis message will be updated by 19:30 on Saturday 23 November, or as the situation changes.",
