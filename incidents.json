The weather increases tide table values by 0.50 m. The total forecast tide is 6.18 metres Chart Datum (3.13 mAOD) at Littlehampton. For 2 hours either side of high tide, minimal flood impacts are expected. A small amount of water could find its way behind the beach and may pond on nearby land and fields including at Climping Street Car Park and Mill Lane. Access could be restricted during and after high tide. Take care if visiting Climping beach. Friday's afternoon tide is forecast to be 30 cm lower. Flood risk should then reduce through to next week, as tide levels fall through a neap cycle. We continue to monitor the forecast and routinely check the condition of the beach at Climping. We will remove this message by 11:00 on 10/03/2023.",
