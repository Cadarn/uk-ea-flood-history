From 14:00 09/08/2021, flooding could affect fields, gardens and rural roads at Fletching Mill Bridge and Sharpsbridge. With significant flows coming down both the Uck and the Ouse, from 16:30 water could affect fields and gardens in Barcombe, as well as approach the Anchor Inn. Barcombe Mills Road could also be affected by flood water. Only minor impacts are expected on Sloop Lane, as the river is already nearing its peak there. The rain has now cleared East Sussex, but further showers are possible Monday afternoon. The river should begin to fall by 04:00 Tuesday 10/08/2021, earlier for communities closer to Ardingly.
