      "message": "This flood alert has been issued as river levels are rising following recent rainfall in the Yorkshire Dales. Consequently, flooding of property, roads and farmland is expected from early afternoon today, Sunday 06/02/2022, and on Monday 07/02/2022. Areas most at risk are low lying land and roads and riverside foot and cycle paths. We expect levels on the River Ouse to rise through Sunday and to peak on Monday morning. The weather remains unsettled for the next few days but we are not currently expecting river levels to rise again significantly. Our incident response staff are closely monitoring the forecast and checking and operating defences as required. Please avoid using low lying footpaths near local watercourses and plan driving routes to avoid low lying roads or carparks near rivers, which may be flooded. This message will be updated in 8 hours or as the situation changes.",
