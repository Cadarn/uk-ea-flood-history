Groundwater levels are above normal for this time of year and communities may continue to be affected by groundwater flooding. The catchment remains sensitive to further rainfall due to the high groundwater levels. The weather forecast is for dry and warm weather over the next 5 days. Low-lying land, gardens, roads, and cellars continue to be at risk of flooding. Due to the nature of groundwater flooding, this situation could continue for several weeks. \nAvoid driving or walking through floodwater as there may be concealed hazards. We are continuing to monitor groundwater levels and will update this message on Friday, 05/07/2024, or as the situation changes. ",
