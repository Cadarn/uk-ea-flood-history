The next tide at 11:30 on Wednesday (09/11/2022) is forecast to be the highest of the week, but only 20cm higher than recent days. Minor flooding could affect gardens of Langney Green, and potentially approach properties at Langney Green too. Fields and parkland including Shinewater Park could also be affected. Wednesday evening's tide at 23:45 09/11/2022 is forecast to be 20cm lower again, and tides will continue to fall for the rest of the week. The rain has now cleared east, beyond Sussex. The next five days are currently predicted to remain dry. This will also allow the river level to very slowly fall through Langney. However, river levels are expected to remain higher than normal until next week. Please take proactive action to help reduce the impact of flooding. Flood protection products are recommended to be installed at Langney Green, if you have them. We are operating our structures at Fence Bridge to help keep the river flowing freely and reduce flood risk. We will update this message by 21:00 09/11/2022.",

      "message": "We have seen heavy rain across the area over the past week. Levels in the River Crane remain high but are falling slowly.\nA high tide is expected at Richmond at around 2.45pm on Wednesday 09 November. Due to high fluvial flows coming down the River Crane, the Crane Tidal Gates may not be able to close to hold back the incoming tide from the River Thames. As a result, the incoming tide may flow up the River Crane which, when combined with the fluvial flow already in the channel, will push levels very high. Some flooding of gardens and low lying land is possible, around Haliburton Road, Eve Road and Talbot Road, although we do not expect any flooding to buildings. Any flooding is likely to be of short duration covering the period around high tide.   \n\nAvoid walking, cycling or driving through flood water. \nWe are constantly monitoring river levels.\nThis message will be updated at 7pm or as the situation changes. \n",
