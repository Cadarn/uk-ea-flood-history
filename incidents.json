Areas most at risk include the Upper Derwent from Seathwaite to Derwent Water. Further rainfall is forecast through till late afternoon, today (Saturday 12/02/22) but no property flooding is expected. We will continue to monitor the forecast and amend this message if necessary. Our teams have been out checking watercourses for blockages. Avoid using low lying footpaths and any bridges near local watercourses and do not attempt to walk or drive through flood water. Further rainfall tomorrow is possible which might have an effect on these watercourses but the exact pattern of this is not yet clear. This message will be updated on Sunday morning (13/02/2022), or as the situation changes.",
