      "message": "Water levels in the upper Eastern Yar are near their normal although the base flow is now greater as a result of the recent exceptional rainfall. At Alverstone the level has fallen but the overnight rain has stalled this recession. The river at Sandown continues to fall and will be starting to allow low lying flood affected land, cycle tracks and access paths to drain along the lower Yar Valley. Golf Links and Moreton Common Road will be clear of flooding as the levels reduce. Today should be generally dry with some showers but Saturday and Sunday may see sporadic heavier showers and this will continue into Monday. The river will be very sensitive to significant rainfall and isolated heavy showers may cause some further surface water ponding. Please remain prepared for potential impacts over the next 4 days. We will continue to monitor the forecast. Please avoid walking or driving through flood water. This message will be updated by 12:00 on Saturday 31/07/21.",
