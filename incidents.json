The weather increases tide table values by 0.25 m. The total forecast tide is 5.11 metres Chart Datum (2.38 mAOD) at Portsmouth. On Thursday, high energy waves removed a significant amount of shingle at South Hayling. At Eastoke Corner, the beach crest remains very narrow. Whilst the next tide is not overly high, large waves could remove more material from the beach. As a result, for 30 minutes either side of high water, sea front gardens and roads nearest Eastoke Corner may experience minor impact flooding. On Sunday afternoon (13:15 on 27/11/22) the tide is lower and we do not expect impacts. However, in the early hours of Monday morning (01:45 on 28/11/22), the tide level is once again a little more elevated, so we may issue further advice. We continue to monitor the forecast.
