We continue to pump water at Westover Pumping Station whilst river levels allow. However, the flood alert remains in force due to significant water on the Somerset Levels and Moors. The flooding of low lying land and roads remains a risk during Wednesday, 04/12/2024. Areas most at risk include the Ilchester to Yeovilton road near the runway, the Mudford to Limington road and the road at the south end of Westover Trading Estate.\nHeavy rain is forecast for Wednesday evening and into Thursday 05/12/2024. A longer period of rain is forecast to arrive during Friday. We continue to monitor the weather forecast and staff have been out checking rivers for blockages and clearing weed screens. Please remain aware of local water levels and weather conditions, and avoid using low lying footpaths close to rivers. Don't put yourself or others at risk. This message will be updated by 2:00 PM on 05/12/2024, or as the situation changes.\n",
