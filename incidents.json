At Sandown, the river level continues to slowly fall having peaked yesterday morning at around 08:00. \n\nThe weather today will remain mainly dry, which will give water levels a good chance to recover. Some flood impacts to gardens and roads are expected to continue, though this will continue to improve throughout the day. Tomorrow (02/07/21) and over the weekend, further heavy showers are possible across Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. Given how sensitive the river will be to further rainfall, these showers will be monitored closely. Tomorrow, depending on the updated weather forecast assessment, we may look to remove this Flood Alert. However, we would still like residents to remain prepared for potential further flood impacts over the coming days. This message will be updated or removed by 12:00 on Friday 02/07/21.",
