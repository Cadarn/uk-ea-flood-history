Areas most at risk are low-lying agricultural land and roads including Slash Lane at Sileby and the Mountsorrel to Sileby road. \n\nThunderstorms are forecast overnight tonight, 15/05/2022, and into tomorrow morning, 16/05/2022, with low confidence over exact timing and locations. We expect river levels to begin rising at around midnight tonight, with areas beginning to be affected from approximately 06:00 tomorrow morning. Levels are likely to remain high until tomorrow evening.\n\nWe are closely monitoring the situation. Please avoid using low-lying footpaths near local watercourses and plan driving routes to avoid low-lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded.  \n\nThis message will be updated by 09:00 on 16/05/2022, or as the situation changes.",
