High water levels may last for a few days, until the high tides at Great Yarmouth have passed. This is due to a natural tide locking effect. High tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth, is currently restricting the normal drainage out to sea at low tide, of the Broads river system. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boat yards and Ferry road in Horning. We are not currently expecting the situation to escalate, or to issue any further warning messages at this time. Take care on waterside roads and footpaths, and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger. We are monitoring the situation.  We will update this message by 10:00am tomorrow, Monday 8th November.",

Tides will be at their highest between 00:00 and 01:00 tomorrow morning, Monday 08/11/2021, with high tide at 00:30. Flooding to roads and low lying land is expected at these times, however these conditions may apply two to four hours either side of high tide. We expect flooding to affect coastal areas, particularly low lying land and roads nearest the sea. Flooding to properties is not expected. We are closely monitoring the situation and our incident response staff are prepared to respond if required. Please be careful along beaches, promenades, coastal footpaths and roads as large waves and sea spray could be dangerous. This message will be updated tomorrow morning, 08/11/2021, or as the situation changes.
