Areas most at risk include The North Sea coast from Bridlington to Barmston with the particular area of concern being around Bridlington Lifeboat Station. Overtopping waves and spray are expected to cause minor flooding between 01:00 AM and 05:00 AM on Thursday 20/10/2022. No property flooding is expected. We will continue to monitor the forecast and may re-issue this alert for additional high tides if necessary. Please be careful along beaches, promenades, coastal footpaths and roads as large waves and sea spray could be dangerous. Plan driving routes to avoid coastal roads, which may be flooded. This message will be updated by 10:00 AM on 20/10/2022, or as the situation changes.",
