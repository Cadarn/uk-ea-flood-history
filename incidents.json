      "message": "Small, flashier rivers and streams may respond to heavy rainfall as a result of localised thunderstorms passing through the area.  This message has been issued pre-emptively ahead of localised thunderstorms on 01/09/2024 and 02/09/2024.  Given the unpredictable nature of thunderstorms, there is low confidence in the locations and impacts of rainfall at this point.  Areas most at risk are low lying agricultural land, roads and footpaths close to small rivers and streams.  Water levels could rise rapidly and potentially generate deep, fast flows.   \nThunderstorms are forecast over the next 24 hours, with low confidence over exact timing and locations.  \nWe are closely monitoring the situation.  \nPlease stay aware in case further warnings are issued.  \nTo check the status of road closures online, please visit the One Network live map.\nThis message will be updated by 09:00 tomorrow morning, 02/09/2024, or as the situation changes.\n",
