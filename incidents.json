However, a Flood Alert remains in force for the wider area, so flooding of roads and low lying land is still possible, particularly around King and Queens Staith. The River Ouse peaked in York this morning, and is now beginning to fall.  However levels will remain high throughout the day. No further significant rainfall is expected today.\n\nWe will continue to monitor levels closely. Continue to take care on waterside roads and footpaths and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger.",

The total forecast tide is 6.09 metres Chart Datum (3.04 mAOD) at Littlehampton. For 2 hours either side of high tide, minimal flood impacts are expected. A small amount of water could find its way behind the beach and may pond on nearby land and fields including at Climping Street Car Park and Mill Lane. At 23:15 on 02/01/2022‚ the tide is similar. We will issue further advice. We continue to monitor the forecast and routinely check the condition of the beach at Climping. Shingle and debris can be thrown by large waves. Access could be restricted during and after high tide. Take care if visiting Climping beach. We will update this message by 14:00 on 02/01/2022",
