We expect river levels to begin rising at around midnight tonight, with areas beginning to be affected from approximately 06:00 tomorrow morning.

Please avoid using low-lying footpaths near local watercourses and plan driving routes to avoid low-lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded.  \n\nThis message will be updated by 09:00 on 16/05/2022, or as the situation changes.",
