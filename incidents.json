High water levels may last for a few days. This is due to a natural tide locking effect. High tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth is currently restricting the normal drainage of the Broads river system out to sea at low tide. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boat yards and Ferry Road in Horning. Take care on waterside roads and footpaths, and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger.
