Some flooding is expected to continue overnight, affecting land near the Beverley Brook. Low-lying land, roads and gardens in the New Malden area are most affected, where river levels have fallen slightly but remain high. Surface water flooding impacts have also been widely reported. Not all areas have seen the heaviest rain or subsequent flooding. The forecast will remain unsettled overnight, with further heavy showers possible. River levels will fluctuate in response to any further rain experienced, with potential for some additional flooding to take place. We are closely monitoring the situation and will issue Flood Warnings if required. Our staff have been in the area checking our structures and clearing blockages.
