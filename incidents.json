Flooding to roads and low lying land is possible and conditions can apply one to two hours either side of high tide. We are closely monitoring the situation and our incident response staff will be closing flood gates if necessary.

There may be further showers tonight and into tomorrow. The Yeo and Parrett rivers will likely fall slowly during today and tonight but remain relatively high. We continue to monitor the situation, and staff are checking the condition of flood banks and other defences. Please refer to @TravelSomerset for information on local road closures, and avoid walking, cycling or driving through flood water. This message will be updated by 2:00 PM on Monday, 08/04/2024, or as the situation changes. ",

For 2 hours either side of high tide, minimal flood impacts are expected.

Monday's midday tide is forecast to be a very similar height (3.19 mAOD), with minor flood impacts. Tuesday's early morning tide is predicted to be higher (3.65 mAOD), and a small number of properties could be affected by flood water. We continue to monitor the forecast and routinely check the condition of the beach at Climping. Shingle and debris can be thrown by large waves. Access could be restricted during and after high tide.

The weather increases tide table values by 0.43 m. The total forecast tide is 4.23 metres Chart Datum (2.23 mAOD) at Beaulieu. For 30 minutes either side of high water, the tide will flood into the garden of the mill house on the downstream side of the Mill Pond. Minor road flooding at Palace Lane is also expected, making access to the village temporarily more difficult. At 00:15 on 09/04/2024 the tide and flood impacts will be higher than tonight. We will issue further advice tomorrow. We continue to monitor the forecast. For safety, please take care if walking or driving through Beaulieu. The incoming tide will flood the main road quickly.
