For 2 hours either side of high tide, small amounts of water will flood land and fields at Climping. Waves will overtop the sea front, directing water westwards along Mill Lane (from the right of the East car park) towards properties on Climping Street. Water may pond near property and in Climping Street Car Park. Tide levels and waves are forecast to be smaller from Thursday afternoon, with only minimal flood impacts expected. However, very large waves could return Sunday morning 1/1/2023. We continue to monitor the forecast and routinely check the condition of the beach at Climping. Shingle and debris can be thrown by large waves. Avoid walking at the sea front or parking at Climping Street Car Park. Access could be restricted during and after high tide.",
