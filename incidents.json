Groundwater levels are above normal for this time of year and communities may continue to be affected by groundwater flooding as the catchment remains sensitive to further rainfall due to high groundwater levels. The weather forecast is for some overnight rain tonight (21/06/2024) before a period of continued dry and warm weather. Low-lying land, gardens, roads, and cellars will continue to be at risk of flooding. Due to the nature of groundwater flooding, this situation could continue for several weeks or longer. Avoid driving or walking through floodwater as there may be concealed hazards. We are continuing to monitor groundwater levels and will update this message Friday, 28/06/2024, or as the situation changes.",
