Water levels are expected to continue to rise gradually over the next few hours in response to forecast rainfall, together with the natural tide locking effect on the Broads. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boat yards and Ferry Road in Horning. We are not currently expecting the situation to escalate, or to issue any further warning messages at this time. Take care on waterside roads and footpaths, and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger. We are monitoring the situation and not expecting the situation to escalate. We will update this message by 9am tomorrow, Wednesday 28th December.",
