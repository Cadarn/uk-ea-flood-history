Water levels continue to remain high, but are expected to soon start to drop back down towards more normal levels. This is due to a natural tide-locking effect where high tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth restricts the normal drainage out to sea at low tide. The Broads are also impacted by high river flows and high groundwater levels, meaning that the tide-locking effect is taking longer to clear. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boatyards and Ferry Road in Horning. We are not currently expecting the situation to escalate, or to issue any further warning messages at this time. Take care on waterside roads and footpaths, and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger. We are monitoring the situation and will issue further messages if the situation changes.",

The Alkham Bourne is flowing, with large sections of upper and lower Nailbourne now also seeing flows. There are some flooding impacts being seen on low-lying land, roads and water infrastructure in and around the Elham Valley, Alkham, and Petham. Other communities in East Kent may also experience impacts this winter. Please avoid walking or driving through flood water. \n\nGroundwater and river levels are expected to remain high until the Spring in 2024 and they are likely to respond to further rainfall. The weather forecast is largely dry until Christmas Day when we may see some further rainfall and unsettled weather towards the New Year.
