Further rainfall is expected today, 12/07/21, therefore flooding of low lying roads and farmland is possible especially in the Longbridge Mill area. Localised heavy thunderstorms are forecast today although timings and locations are uncertain. It is therefore possible that river levels will continue to rise in response to the rainfall. We are closely monitoring the situation. Please remain safe and aware of your local surroundings and refer to the 'River and Sea levels in England' webpage for current river levels. This message will be updated this evening, 12/07/21, or as the situation changes.",
