      "message": "Wednesday afternoon's tide at 14:30 on 28/12/2022 is higher than normal due to unsettled weather with strong South Westerly Force 7 winds and large waves. The weather increases tide table values by 0.58 m. The total forecast tide is 4.70 metres Chart Datum (2.11 mAOD) at Cowes. For 1 hour either side of high water, large waves will cause spray overtopping and overwashing of defences across the exposed coast at Freshwater Bay, Sandown, Shanklin, Gurnard and Ryde. This will flood sea front esplanades, car parks and roads. As Cowes is largely sheltered from the waves, impacts will be more minimal. We do not expect property flooding. At 03:45 on 29/12/2022, as wave heights remain elevated, some minor impact spray overtopping affecting the southern coastal frontage may continue. After this time, no further impacts are expected. We continue to monitor the forecast. At high tide, avoid parking, walking or driving at exposed sea front locations. We will remove this message by 18:00 on 28/12/2022.",

Water levels are expected to continue to rise gradually over the next few hours in response to forecast rainfall, together with the natural tide locking effect on the Broads. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boat yards and Ferry Road in Horning. We are not currently expecting the situation to escalate, or to issue any further warning messages at this time. Take care on waterside roads and footpaths, and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger. We are monitoring the situation and not expecting the situation to escalate. We will update this message by 9am tomorrow, Wednesday 28th December.",
