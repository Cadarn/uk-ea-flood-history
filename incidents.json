The tide in the early hours of tomorrow morning 23/08/24  is expected to be higher than usual due to the forecast weather conditions and spring tides. Areas most at risk include Christchurch Harbour and tidal stretches of the Lower Stour and Avon. The high water level is expected to reach 1.22mAOD at 12:24 AM with southerly force 6 winds. (mAOD is height above average sea level - for more info refer to local tide tables.) Sea spray overtopping along the coast is possible and high water levels in the harbour are forecast. Flooding to roads and low lying land is possible and conditions can apply one to two hours either side of high tide.
