High water levels may last for a few days, until the high tides and tidal surge at Great Yarmouth have passed. This is due to a natural tide locking effect, and tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth is currently restricting the normal drainage of the Broads river system out to sea at low tide. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boat yards and Ferry Road in Horning. The current series of high spring tides has now reached its peak, although a tidal surge is restricting the freshwater river flows to drain out to sea at low tide as normal. There is potential for further Flood Alerts and Flood Warnings to be issued. Take care on waterside roads and footpaths, and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger.

In the last 3 months, prolonged, higher than average rainfall (353mm), has been recorded in Bishops Sutton. From Friday 20/12/2024, it is possible that rising groundwater will reduce the ability of septic tanks at Old Alresford to operate properly. In Preston Candover, a small number of properties may experience cellar flooding. Unsettled weather is expected to return to Hampshire from Wednesday 18/12/2024 into Thursday 19/12/2024 with between 15 and 35mm of rain possible. Following this rainfall, groundwater levels may begin to rise more rapidly. Friday 20/12/2024 and Saturday 21/12/2024 are expected to be mostly dry. We expect groundwater levels in Preston Candover and Old Alresford will likely continue rising for most of December in response to this week’s rain. We continue to monitor the groundwater levels and weather forecast. If you use pumps to help reduce water levels, please ensure that they can operate. This Flood Alert will be updated by 17:00 on Tuesday 24/12/2024.",
