Today (Tuesday 02/01/2024) out of bank flooding will impact fields at Titchfield Hill, with high water levels at Titchfield Mill, Bridge Cottage and the Tanneries Industrial Estate. While groundwater and river levels are currently so high, any intense rainfall events are now likely to cause surface water flooding in Titchfield High Street. Further rain is forecast for this morning and Thursday. The river may continue to rise until 23:00 this evening. Low lying land will remain flooded over the next few days. Given the rain forecast, it is possible that a Flood Warning may need to be issued for onset of property flooding from the river, mainly affecting Bridge Cottage. Our operational staff will keep the river clear of reported blockages. We continue to monitor the forecast. Please avoid walking or driving through flood water.

Levels suggest that there will be flooding to low lying land and roads close to the river. More heavy rain accompanied by very windy conditions on Tuesday will cause river levels to rise again.
