No flood impacts are expected at The Sadlers in Westhampnett or in Chichester City Centre. Only a small amount of light drizzle is forecast Monday. The River Lavant should continue to slowly fall. There is uncertainty in the weather forecast for Tuesday. A band of rain forecast from 08:00 12/03/2024, could briefly raise water levels by a few centimetres, increasing flood impacts a little. No rain is currently forecast Wednesday and Thursday, which should enable river levels to again slowly fall. Plan to avoid driving routes vulnerable to flooding including Sheepwash Lane.

Minor groundwater flood impacts are expected to continue, with springs affecting fields and water on roads including Stoughton main road and large volumes of water on the road from East Marden. Groundwater will affect a small number of properties close to the village green Stoughton. Groundwater could affect basements or be near the ground floor of properties in Walderton too. Light drizzle is forecast Monday. A small amount of rain is forecast Tuesday 12/03/2024, with no rain forecast Wednesday and Thursday. Groundwater levels are not expected to rise significantly this week, and could continue to fall at the Compton borehole. Groundwater will remain higher than normal and sensitive to any rainfall throughout March and possibly April, with minor flood impacts persisting until that time too. If you have pumps to help reduce groundwater levels in your property, ensure they are operational. We continue to monitor the levels and forecast. We will update this message by 18:00 15/03/2024",
