      "message": "The River Arun at Pulborough is still high, following a very wet start to October. However, river levels are now slowly falling. Water will still affect fields and gardens, particularly near to Swan Bridge, Pulborough and Bridge Cottages, Greatham. At 15:30 on Friday (08/10/2021), the river at Houghton Bridge, Amberley, should not peak any higher than was seen on Wednesday lunchtime (06/10/2021), but water will still be close to the tops of the banks. Flooding is not currently expected this week in Arundel or Ford. Very little rain is forecast for the next 5 days and water levels at Pulborough will fall during that whole period. However, flows will not reduce significantly on the lower Arun until next week. From Saturday (09/10/2021), peak water levels at Houghton Bridge will fall by about 10 centimetres each day. Please keep flood protection products in place, if you have them, while minor residual flood impacts remain. Our pumps in Pulborough are running to help reduce the risk of flooding. We will reissue this message if the risk of flooding to properties increases.",
