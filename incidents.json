Minor flood impacts in the area, affecting fields, gardens and rural roads, should begin to slowly ease. River levels should return to near normal in Fittleworth, by Thursday 12/08/2021. In Liss, Sheet, Iping, Midhurst and Lodsbridge near Selham, river levels have already returned to normal. The weather forecast predicts high pressure and no more than 1 or 2 mm of rain for the next five days, and therefore very little flood risk in the week ahead. However, the ground is now a lot wetter than normal for the time of year. Any future rainfall events in the coming weeks are likely to generate a response from the river. We will continue to monitor the river levels and forecast and will re-issue this message if the risk of flooding could return.",
