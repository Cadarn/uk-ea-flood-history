      "message": "On Wednesday, 16th March, heavy rain fell in the river Nene catchment area. This caused the rise in the river levels and the flow peak is now travelling through the Middle Nene, approaching the Lower Nene. This means levels are gradually rising on the Lower Nene, which will continue to cause flooding of low lying land and roads close to the river today, Saturday, 19th March onwards. We expect the river to remain high throughout the next few days. Our forecasts indicate that flooding to properties is not likely, however a flood warning for the North Bank Road is in force, as the high levels in the river coincide with high tides today and tomorrow (Sunday, 20th March) and will cause the road to flood leading to treacherous driving conditions. We are constantly monitoring river levels, and have staff in the field checking for blockages and clearing weedscreens. Please avoid using low lying footpaths near local watercourses and plan driving routes to avoid low lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded. This message will be updated on Sunday, 20th March, or as the situation changes.",
