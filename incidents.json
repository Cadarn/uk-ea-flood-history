Large waves and spray overtopping are forecast to cause flooding and damage along the coast at Seascale, Ravenglass, Saltcoats, Haverigg. Vulnerable properties along the foreshore at Braystones, Nethertown and Coulderton are susceptible to these conditions. Impacts are possible 2 hours either side of high tide forecast, at 12:30 PM. We do not expect to see similar impacts for tonight’s high tide, but further unsettled weather is forecast, as a result we may issue further alerts and warnings over the next 2 to 3 days. Our incident response staff are closing flood gates and checking defences. Stay away from beaches, promenades, coastal footpaths and roads as large waves and sea spray could be dangerous.
