Minor flooding will continue to affect fields, rural roads, and gardens including The Old Clergy House, properties near Willows Car Park on North Street, River Lane and Deans Place Hotel, Alfriston. A Flood Alert remains in force to describe minor flood impacts. A small amount of rain (5mm) could be possible on Tuesday afternoon (01/10/2024), but this should not cause river levels to rise significantly. Only isolated showers are forecast for the rest of the week. The river should continue to fall through Tuesday, and should return nearer to normal by Wednesday afternoon (02/10/2024). However, another area of low pressure is forecast this weekend, which could cause flood risk to return. Flood water can be deep and dangerous, please take care if walking near the river in Alfriston. Please plan to avoid driving on routes vulnerable to flooding, including North Street. We continue to monitor the levels and forecast.
