Flooding to low lying land, roads and gardens is possible from Saturday morning. Flooding from surface water could also occur.\n\nWe expect river levels to respond by rising quickly in areas receiving the heaviest rain. We recommend you stay aware of local weather conditions and water levels. Consider putting your flood plan into action. You should avoid walking, cycling or driving through flood water.\n\nWe expect the band of rain to move out of the area on Saturday evening, scattered showers are forecast for Sunday.
