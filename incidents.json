At our indicator borehole at East Dean, groundwater is now one metre below the surface and falling nearly 10 centimetres each day. Very few impacts remain visible above ground, with only minimal amounts of water on roads. However, groundwater could continue to affect basements, and affect the ability of the sewage network to operate, potentially into March. Although the week ahead should remain predominantly dry, there is the chance of a small amount of rain around at times, with 5mm of rain currently forecast on Wednesday 22/02/2023 and the chance of some more unsettled weather through mid March. Details are very uncertain, and long term weather forecasting is difficult, but so long as we do not receive extremely wet weather, groundwater is expected to continue to fall through spring and summer. We will continue to monitor levels and forecasts. If you have pumps to help manage water levels in basements, please ensure they are operational.
