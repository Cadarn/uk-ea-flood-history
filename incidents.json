In the last 7 days, more than half a month’s rain (63mm) has been recorded at Broughton but for the next five days relatively small amounts of rain are forecast. In the coming week, we expect groundwater levels in Kings Somborne to remain high and the Somborne Stream to rise further up the valley. There is an increasing risk of cellar flooding. On Thursday (04/01/2024), there is a possibility that heavy rain (45mm) could be recorded in Hampshire which will cause a more rapid rise in groundwater levels, further increasing the risk of cellar and road flooding.

Flooding of roads and some properties, especially basements is expected. \nResidents should deploy any property resilience measures such as pumps, flood barriers and air brick covers.\nDriving through flood water will be especially dangerous as temperatures will drop to below freezing at times over the next week and will cause ice to form on roads. The bow wave from vehicles can flood adjacent properties and lead to icing of pavements.\nSewage systems may become overloaded. Do not lift manhole covers to alleviate local surface water flooding as this may cause toilets further downhill to surcharge.\nThis message will be updated on Saturday the 6th January, or as the situation changes.\n",
