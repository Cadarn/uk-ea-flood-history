      "message": "The water level in the Lymington River at Brockenhurst has fallen after a dry spell following recent rainfall. Over the last three days, 33mm of rain has been recorded in Brockenhurst. This is a third of the average monthly rainfall for January. Heavy rain is possible Wednesday evening (29/01/2025) with potentially 20mm affecting Hampshire. If heavy rain affects the catchment, river levels will rise again flooding land and roads, including Burley Road, Brockenhurst. The river could be very high through Martin’s Road and Balmer Lawn Road, where garden flooding is a possibility. We continue to monitor the forecast and will reissue this Flood Alert as levels rise. Our operations staff are out working to ensure rivers remain free of any reported blockages. Please avoid driving through watersplashes as water may be deep.
