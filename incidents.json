Water will enter Currymoor reservoir via Hookbridge spillway when this level exceeds 7.45 m. The drain level at Currymoor pumping station is 6.65 m and is falling by approximately 8 mm per hour. The current forecast for the next 5 days shows no rain, and we expect the situation on the moors to continue improving this week. We are currently pumping at Currymoor, Northmoor and Saltmoor, to remove as much water from the moors as river and drain levels allow. River Parrett levels are being managed with the Sowy relief channel in order to assist pumping at these stations. We are monitoring the situation very closely. Our staff remain busy overseeing pumping operations and checking weed-screens, flood-banks and spillways. This message will be updated on Wednesday, 25/01/23, or as the situation changes.",

Minor groundwater flood impacts are expected to continue, with springs and minor flooding affecting fields, the village green Stoughton, and rural roads including Stoughton main road, the road from East Marden and also between Cooks Lane and The Barley Mow, and the B2146 near Woodlands Lane, in Walderton. However, with no rain since 16/01/2023, groundwater at our indicator borehole in Compton has started to slowly fall, by about 20 centimetres each day. No rain is currently forecast in the week ahead. Groundwater levels in Stoughton and Walderton should stabilise this week, but will remain close to the surface. Long term weather forecasting is difficult, but rain could return from mid February, which could extend or cause the return of groundwater flood impacts. We will continue to monitor levels and forecasts. If you have pumps to help manage water levels in basements, please ensure they are operational. We will update this message by 17:00 30/01/2023.",
