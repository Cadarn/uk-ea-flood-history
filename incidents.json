Levels are expected to continue rising until at least the end of next week. You can monitor groundwater levels at the Kingston Russell borehole on the Check-for-Flooding.gov.uk website. Further heavy rainfall is expected in the middle of next week. Please avoid driving through flood water as the bow wave can flood nearby properties and can seriously damage your engine.
