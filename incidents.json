Very few impacts remain visible above ground, with only minimal amounts of water on roads. However, water is expected to remain in basements or under floorboards of properties in East Dean, Charlton, Singleton and West Dean.

Details are very uncertain, but so long as we do not receive extremely wet weather, groundwater is expected to continue to fall. However, long term weather forecasting is difficult.
