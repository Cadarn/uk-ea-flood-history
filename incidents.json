At Alverstone, the level is falling (15mm per hour) and the river at Sandown is now reducing but will take some days to return to its summer level. Today (29/07/21) flood impacts to land, cycle tracks and access paths will start to improve along the Yar Valley as ponded water slowly drains to the river. Golf Links and Moreton Common Road will also start to clear of flooding as the level at Sandown reduces. Today should be generally dry with some showers but Saturday and Sunday may see heavier showers. The river will be very sensitive to any significant rain and may cause some further ponding over the weekend. Please remain prepared for further potential impacts over the next 5 days. We continue to monitor the forecast. Please avoid walking or driving through flood water. This message will be updated by 11:00 on Friday 30/07/21.",
