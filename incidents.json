      "message": "Wednesday's early morning tide at 01:30 on 08/12/2021 is forecast to be 30cm lower than Tuesday, but with much bigger waves and strong South Westerly Force 6 winds due to Storm Barra. The weather increases tide table values by 0.24 m. The total forecast tide is 5.06 metres Chart Datum (2.32 mAOD) at Chichester Harbour. For 1 hour either side of high water, the tide will flood Shore Road. At Bosham High Street, water could be near to or flood front door steps. Around Chichester harbour, some gardens or land at shore side properties could also be affected. Strong winds will continue until Thursday. However, wave heights, tide levels and flood impacts and risk should reduce from Wednesday afternoon. We continue to monitor the forecast. If you have them, please install flood boards 1 hour before high tide. Avoid walking through flood water as it may contain hidden hazards and be deep in places. We will update this message by 11:00 on 08/12/2021",

The weather increases tide table values by 0.33 m. The total forecast tide is 5.08 metres Chart Datum (2.35 mAOD) at Portsmouth. The tide will be much lower than it was this afternoon, but the residual impacts from Storm Barra may still cause some minor impact flooding. For 30 minutes either side of high water, spray overtopping of sea defence walls into low lying coastal roads between Hillhead and Gosport, namely Cliff Road and Stokes Bay Road, is expected. At Hillhead, low lying sea front car parks may flood. Property flooding is not expected. After this tide‚ the weather is more settled, and no further impacts are expected. We continue to monitor the forecast. Be careful if driving at Gosport sea front at high tide. Large waves can carry and throw shingle and debris, which could affect the main road at Stokes Bay.
