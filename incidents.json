Tides are expected to be higher than usual, due to the forecast weather conditions during spring tides. Clacton Promenade, Lee-over-Sands and Brightlingsea seafront may see some wave overtopping and spray. The Strood at Mersea Island, Coast Road and car parks on the front at West Mersea, and the Hythe and Promenade at Maldon may be flooded. The detailed forecast for those that use it is for a peak level at Clacton of 2.76 mAODN at 02:00am, on Friday 28th October, which is 0.22m above tide tables, wind Force 4, southerly. (mAODN is height above average sea level, for more info refer to local tide tables). The current series of high spring tides has now reached its peak and will fall away over the next few days. Take care on coastal roads and footpaths, and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger. We are monitoring the situation and not expecting it to escalate. We will update this message by 10am on Friday 28th October.",
