Consequently flooding of roads and farmland is possible later this evening from 8:30pm and overnight. Flooding may start to affect low lying land and roads adjacent to the river from the Welsh border at Llawnt to Shrawardine near Shrewsbury. Other locations that may be affected include Llanymynech, Maesbrook and Melverley. Predicted peaks:- Llanymynech 3.1m to 3.5m overnight. Currently flooding is not expected at other gauge locations. We expect river levels to have fallen by tomorrow morning, Saturday 08/10/2022. We are closely monitoring the situation. Please avoid using low lying footpaths near local watercourses and plan driving routes to avoid low lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded.
