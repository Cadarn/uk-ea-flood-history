The forecast high tide at Great Yarmouth will restrict the Broads river system from draining out to sea, which will result in higher than normal water levels within the Broads. Areas most at risk are in Ludham, Repps, Bastwick, Potter Heigham, New Bridge and Hickling Heath, and the A149 road. We are not currently expecting the situation to escalate, or to issue any further warning messages at this time. Be ready to take action to protect your property if flooding is expected. We are monitoring the situation. We will update this message by 5pm today, Thursday 21st November, or as the situation changes.\t\n",
