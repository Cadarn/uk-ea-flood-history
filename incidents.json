From 10:00 (02/01/2024), the river will flood land, fields and roads at Cadnam, West Wellow, Landford and Ower. Water levels will also be very high around the mill building at East Wellow. In the next 8 hours, further heavy rain is forecast with up to 15mm possible. Given the amount of rain currently affecting the area, by 18:00 it is possible that a Flood Warning will be issued for onset of isolated property flooding. We continue to monitor the forecast. Our operations staff will work to ensure the river remains free of any reported blockages. Please ensure that pumps used to protect property are operating correctly. This Flood Alert will be updated by 15:00 on 03/01/2024 or sooner, if we think property flooding will occur.",

Over the last week we have seen heavy rain fall across Devon, and further spells of rain, which may be heavy in places are expected on Tuesday evening and overnight. This means that river levels in the South Devon Rivers area will rise, and will remain high for the next couple of days, as heavy rain is falling on already wet catchments. Levels suggest that there will be flooding to low lying land and roads close to the river. More heavy rain accompanied by very windy conditions on Tuesday night through to Wednesday will cause river levels to rise again.

Over the last week we have seen heavy rain fall across Devon, and further spells of rain, which may be heavy in places are expected on Tuesday evening and overnight. This means that river levels in the Lower Torridge Area will rise, and will remain high for the next couple of days, as heavy rain is falling on already wet catchments. Levels suggest that there will be flooding to low lying land and roads close to the river. More heavy rain accompanied by very windy conditions on Tuesday night through to Wednesday will cause river levels to rise again.
