We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boat yards and Ferry road in Horning.

Minor flooding will likely continue to affect fields, gardens and roads near Pulborough through the weekend, while the river is still much higher than normal. However, with a predominantly dry week ahead in the weather forecast, flood impacts and standing water should ease as river flows will continue to reduce over the next few days. Our pumps in Pulborough will continue to run, to help reduce the risk of flooding. Please keep flood protection products in place, if you have them, while residual flood impacts remain. We will reissue this message if the risk of flooding to properties increases again.",

The forecast is dry today and maybe a shower tomorrow Sunday.  The Flood Alert remains in force for the wider area and the flooding of roads and low lying land may still be possible.
