This is due to a natural tide locking effect. High tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth, is currently restricting the normal drainage out to sea at low tide, of the Broads river system. We expect to see high water levels at Beccles Quay. The current series of high spring tides has now reached its peak, and will fall away over the next few days, allowing the freshwater river flows to drain out to sea at low tide as normal again.
