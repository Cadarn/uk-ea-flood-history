Water levels continue to remain high, but are expected to soon start to drop back down to more normal levels. This is due to a natural tide-locking effect where high tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth restricts the normal drainage out to sea at low tide. The Broads are also impacted by river flows and high groundwater levels, meaning that the tide-locking effect is taking longer to clear. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boat yards and Ferry Road in Horning. We are not currently expecting the situation to escalate, or to issue any further warning messages at this time. Take care on waterside roads and footpaths, and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger. We are monitoring the situation and will issue further messages if the situation changes.

There are some flooding impacts being seen on low-lying land, roads and water infrastructure in and around the Elham Valley, Alkham, and Petham. Other communities in East Kent may also experience impacts this winter. Please avoid walking or driving through flood water. \n\nGroundwater and river levels are expected to remain high until the Spring in 2024 and they are likely to respond to further rainfall. The weather forecast is largely dry until Christmas Day when we may see some further rainfall and unsettled weather towards the New Year. We continue to monitor the situation and are co-ordinating efforts with the local authorities and communities around the deployment of temporary defences. Our staff are maintaining and clearing key structures. This message will be updated by 28 December 2023, or as the situation changes. Search ‘Kent Groundwater Situation’ on gov.uk.",

Please stay away from beaches, promenades, coastal footpaths and roads as the expected large waves and sea spray will be dangerous.
