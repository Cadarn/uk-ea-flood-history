The Alkham Bourne and the Nailbourne between Lyminge and Littlebourne are flowing. Localised flooding will continue to affect low-lying land, roads, and water infrastructure around the Elham Valley, Alkham and Petham. Other communities in East Kent may also be impacted. Please avoid walking or driving through flood water. Further periods of wet weather are forecast from Saturday 16th March and into next week. This is likely to result in slightly higher groundwater levels and flows.
