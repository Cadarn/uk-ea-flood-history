We expect flooding to affect the tidal River Avon from Sea Mills to Conham in Bristol and between the Avonmouth Bridge and Shirehampton Park including Pill and Shirehampton.   Tides will remain high until Monday evening 15/08/22 so this alert will remain in place until then. \nWe are closely monitoring the situation.   Our incident response staff are closing flood gates and checking defences.  \nPlease avoid using low lying footpaths near local watercourses and be careful along promenades, coastal footpaths and roads.\nThis message will be updated by 11:00 on Sunday, 14/08/22, or as the situation changes. \n",
