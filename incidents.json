The weather increases tide table values by 0.54 m. The total forecast tide is 5.37 metres Chart Datum (2.64 mAOD) at Portsmouth. For 1 hour either side of high water, spray overtopping of sea defence walls into low lying coastal roads between Hillhead and Gosport, namely Cliff Road and Stokes Bay Road, is expected. At Hillhead, low lying sea front car parks may flood. Property flooding is not expected. At 00:47 on Thursday (03/08/2023)‚ the tide level remains elevated but will be lower than at Wednesday lunchtime. Currently it is unlikely that it will cause flooding to property‚ but we may issue further advice tomorrow (02/08/2023). We continue to monitor the forecast. Be careful if driving, parking or walking at Gosport sea front at high tide. Large waves can carry and throw shingle and debris, which will affect the main road at Stokes Bay. We will remove this message by 18:00 on 02/08/2023. ",
