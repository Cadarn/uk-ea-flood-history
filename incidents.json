Gardens or land of shore side properties around the Harbour could also be affected. Thursday's early morning tide is forecast to be 20cm lower, although still accompanied by large waves and strong winds (Force 5). Minor flood risks could remain until Thursday afternoon (03/08/2023) when tide levels, wind and waves should have reduced. We continue to monitor the forecast. If you have them, please install flood boards 1 hour before high tide. Avoid walking through flood water as it may contain hidden hazards and be deep in places.
