River levels still remain high 30/05/2021, as a result of the recent rainfall, but are continuing to fall very slowly at the Brokenborough river gauge. No further rain is forecast over the next few days so levels are expected to continue to fall. We continue to  monitor the situation. Our incident response staff are clearing weed screens. Please plan driving routes to avoid low lying roads near rivers which may be flooded and refer to local authority website for local road closures. This message will be updated by 10:00 on Monday 31/05/2021, or as the situation changes.  ",
