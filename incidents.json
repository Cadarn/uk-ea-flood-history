High water levels may last for a few days, until the high tides and tidal surge at Great Yarmouth have passed. This is due to a natural tide locking effect, and tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth is currently restricting the normal drainage of the Broads river system out to sea at low tide. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boat yards and Ferry Road in Horning. The current series of high spring tides has now reached its peak, although a tidal surge is restricting the freshwater river flows to drain out to sea at low tide as normal.
