      "message": "The water level in the lower River Meon at Titchfield remains high but stable following months of prolonged wet weather and heavy rainfall recorded on Saturday (09/12/23). Today (Sunday 10/12/23) and tomorrow (Monday 11/12/23) out of bank flooding will impact fields at Titchfield Hill with high water levels at Titchfield Mill, Bridge Cottage and the Tanneries Industrial Estate. Showers are forecast tomorrow (11/12/23) but the volume of rain should be small (similar to today). The river should remain stable and may even lower a little. On Tuesday (12/12/23) heavier rain is forecast with up to 20mm expected. If this volume of rain affects the river then the level will rise and deeper flood water will affect the area. Low lying land will remain flooded for at least the next 2 weeks. Property flooding directly from the river is not currently expected. Our operational staff will keep the river clear of reported blockages. We continue to monitor the forecast. Please avoid walking or driving through flood water. This Flood Alert will be updated by 17:00 on Tuesday 12/12/23.",
