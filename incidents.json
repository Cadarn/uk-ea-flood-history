      "message": "In Deane and Ashe, groundwater levels are high and continue to rise slowly. In the last 7 days, the level has risen by 34cm. In the last 3 months, 265mm of rain has been recorded at Overton. This is more than the long-term average rainfall expected for this period. The River Test will be flowing in Deane and Ashe. Rising groundwater will also begin to affect the ability of septic tanks to operate properly. During this week, the weather will remain fairly dry, but groundwater will continue to rise for most of January, in response to the rainfall recorded at the beginning of the month. We continue to monitor the forecast. In Deane, we would like residents to prepare for cellar flooding impacts, which are possible by the end of January. If you use pumps to help reduce water levels, please ensure that they are operating. We will update this Flood Alert by 17:00 on Monday 20/01/2025.",
