Please avoid walking or driving through flood water. The forecast is dry conditions today 26th April and will be wet at times this weekend. \n\nWe are monitoring the situation and are working with local authorities and communities with the deployment of temporary defences, such as Canterbury City Council’s temporary defences in Barham and the Littlebourne Flood Relief channel.
