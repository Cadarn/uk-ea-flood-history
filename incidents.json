Some roads remain closed at fording points. The internal flooding of residential properties is not expected. The Littlebourne Flood Relief Channel is in partial operation and temporary defences operate in Barham. Please avoid driving in floodwater as bow waves from vehicles may cause property flooding. Environment Agency operatives are ensuring the free flow of water. We are monitoring the situation and co-ordinating efforts with local authorities and community leaders.
