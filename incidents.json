      "message": "The combination of spring tides and strong winds may result in waves overtopping sea defences. The forecast high water is at 06:15 on Saturday morning, 04/12/21, with a level of 6.48 mAOD and a Force 7 North Westerly wind. \nAll times are local and refer to the high water time at Hinkely Point, mAOD is height above average sea level.\nFlooding to coastal areas and the most vulnerable properties is possible and may occur one to two hours either side of the high tide. The area most at risk is the coastline between The Warren and Sea Lane End including Dunster Beach Chalets. High spring tides will continue until Tuesday 07/12/21 but this flood warning is unlikely to be reissued as the wind strength is forecast to reduce.\n\nPlease consider installing property flood resilience equipment. Our incident response staff are closing flood gates.\nThis message will be updated by 12:00 on Saturday, 04/12/21, or as the situation changes.",
