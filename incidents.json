River levels are currently falling, but flood impacts will continue to affect a small number of properties in Barcombe Mills and at the Anchor Inn, with Barcombe Mills Road and Anchor Lane likely to be impassable. Flood water will continue to be extensive through fields. In the early hours of Friday another 15mm of rain was recorded, and the upper Ouse near Ardingly is rising again. This will likely slow the fall in water level at Barcombe, possibly causing a slight rise Friday afternoon. A dry day Friday should see the river return to a more normal level by Saturday 05/11/2022. However, 25mm of rain forecast for Sunday, could cause some further flooding. Please plan to avoid driving through routes vulnerable to flooding, including Barcombe Mills Road. Flood protection products are recommended to be installed in Barcombe, if you have them. We are operating our structures in Barcombe to help keep the river flowing freely and reduce flood risk.
