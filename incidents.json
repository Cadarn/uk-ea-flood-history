The weather increases tide table values by 0.38 m. The total forecast tide is 4.29 metres Chart Datum (2.29 mAOD) at Beaulieu. For 1 hour either side of high water, the tide will flood the garden of the Mill House on the downstream side of the Mill Pond. It will also flow across Palace Lane and the B3056 (Hatchet Lane), making it temporarily more difficult for traffic to access the village. Flood water in Palace Lane could be up to 0.2m deep. After this tide, the weather becomes more settled, so levels will reduce and no further impacts are expected. For safety, please take care if walking through Beaulieu. The incoming tide will flood roads quickly. At Hatchet Lane, driving through flood water increases flood risk to property. Please avoid using this road. We continue to monitor the forecast.
