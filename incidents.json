      "message": "The River Ouse is still high near Barcombe, following Wednesday's heavy rainfall. However, water levels have fallen from Thursday's peak. Minor flooding will continue to affect the Anchor Inn, Anchor Lane and Barcombe Mills Road until Friday evening. A flood alert remains in force to communicate these impacts, and the extensive water through nearby fields that will continue until the weekend. However, the weather forecast is for 5 predominantly dry days, other than the chance of an isolated shower on Sunday and Monday. No new property flooding is expected in Barcombe so we are removing this flood warning. Some roads may be affected by flood water, including those mentioned within this message. Please plan to avoid driving through routes vulnerable to flooding. Please keep flood protection products in place while residual flood impacts remain. We are operating our structures in Barcombe to help keep the river flowing freely and reduce flood risk. We will reissue this flood warning if the risk of property flooding increases.",
