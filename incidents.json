      "message": "Water levels in the upper Eastern Yar are near their normal but the base flow is now greater due to the recent exceptional rainfall. At Alverstone the level is continuing its slow recession again. The river at Sandown continues to fall slowly allowing low lying flood affected land, ditches, cycle tracks and access paths to drain along the lower Yar Valley. Golf Links and Moreton Common Road will be clear of flooding as these levels reduce. Todayâ€™s forecast is for heavy thundery showers this afternoon, which may align into bands of heavy rain but clearing late evening. Sunday may see further heavy showers and this will continue into Monday. The river will be very sensitive to significant rainfall and may cause some surface water ponding or briefly increase river levels. Please remain prepared for potential impacts over the next 3 days. We will continue to monitor the forecast. Please avoid walking or driving through flood water. This message will be updated by 12:00 on Sunday 1/08/21.",
