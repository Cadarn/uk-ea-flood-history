However, the river is now slowly falling and the weather is forecast to remain predominantly dry for the next couple of days. Minor flood impacts will likely continue to affect fields near Shripney Lane and the A259, and possibly land around caravans at Riverside Caravan Centre and Rowan Park Caravan Park, but extents and depths of water should gradually ease as the river falls through Shripney, Bersted and Aldingbourne. The lowering of water levels will be slow and the Aldingbourne Rife will remain higher than normal until next week. No flood impacts are expected in Barnham, where river levels have fallen a lot quicker, and are already close to normal flow. Please keep flood protection products in place while residual flood impacts remain. Our pumps at Felpham are running, and we will keep grilles clear through Barnham, including at the Trading Post, to reduce flood risk.
