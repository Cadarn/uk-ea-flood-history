Flooding may continue to affect fields near Shripney Lane and the A259, the car park at Tesco and Riverside Caravan Centre and Rowan Park Caravan Park. Only minor flood impacts are expected in Barnham. The Aldingbourne and Barnham Rifes should slowly fall all week. However, through Shripney and Bersted minor flood impacts may still continue through this weekend. It will likely take a fortnight of dry weather for river levels to return nearer to normal. River levels will remain sensitive to future rainfall. Please plan to avoid driving through routes vulnerable to flooding, including Shripney Lane. We continue to routinely clear grilles through Barnham, including at the Trading Post and our pumps at Felpham are running to reduce flood risk. We will update this message by 11:00 04/12/2022.",
