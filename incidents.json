Some out of bank flooding may also occur in fields at Langbridge. Access issues at Horringford and impacts at Sandown are likely. Rain should clear the area by 01:00 (26/07/2021) but a further 20mm of rain could fall in this time. At Alverstone, the river is unlikely to peak until at least 07:00 tomorrow morning (26/07/2021). We continue to monitor the forecast and will ensure the river remains free of any reported blockages. In Alverstone, pumps used to protect gardens from flooding may be required to operate. This Flood Alert will be updated by 10:00 26/07/2021 and we will issue a Flood Warning if we think property flooding is imminent.",
