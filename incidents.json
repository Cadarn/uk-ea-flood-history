At Sandown the river continues to rise and is not expected to peak until at least 19:30 this evening (26/07/21). Over the next 24 hours, water levels will remain very high and flooding of gardens, access and cycle tracks will continue. Golf Links Road and Moreton Common Road will experience minor impact flooding. Ditches at Fort Holiday Park may also struggle to drain. Today (Monday 26/07/21) and for the rest of this week, the risk of further fast moving, heavy and scattered showers continues. The river will be incredibly sensitive to any further rainfall and we are monitoring the situation closely. Even though the river should continue lowering for the rest of this afternoon and early evening, we would like residents to remain prepared for further potential flood impacts this week.
