Flood impacts affecting fields, gardens, roads and being very close to a small number of properties may continue on Station Road, Church Lane and Church Road Hellingly. The Cuckmere River along Mill Lane, has already fallen considerably from its peak. The river through Alfriston is still slowly rising, and will start to fall slowly by 22:00 21/10/2021. Water may be in the fields, and minor flood impacts could still also be affecting North Street, Willows Car Park, River Lane, The Old Clergy House and Deans Place Hotel, Alfriston. Very little rain is forecast until Sunday, but river levels are likely to stay higher than normal until next week. Please plan to avoid driving through routes susceptible to flooding.

Due to high flows coming down the River Crane, the Crane Tidal Gates will not be able to close to hold back the incoming tide from the River Thames. As a result the incoming tide will flow up the Crane which, when combined with the flow already in the channel, will push levels very high. Some flooding of gardens and low lying land is likely from around 02:30am although we do not expect any flooding to buildings. Any flooding is likely to be of short duration covering the period around high tide. It is forecast to stay dry overnight and tomorrow but levels on the Crane are likely to remain high until tomorrow morning, so there could be further risk of flooding at the following high tide. We are monitoring river levels and have staff on standby to attend any river blockages. Be aware of your surroundings and keep an eye on local conditions. This message will be updated tomorrow morning or earlier if the situation changes.\n",
