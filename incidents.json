Over the last 7 days, there has been a slight increase in level in Appleshaw and Hatherden, as groundwater responded to rain which was recorded between 10th and 13th March. In Kimpton, the level continues to fall. From today (Wednesday 24/03/21) until next week, small amounts of rain are forecast, with heavy showers expected on Friday (26/03/21). In Hatherden and Appleshaw, groundwater has not yet lowered for a period of several successive days.  Rain this week could therefore cause levels to rise (perhaps by another 10 cm or so). Whilst it is unlikely that rain this week will cause impacts, groundwater is only marginally below a level where historically, a small  number of cellars have been affected in Hatherden and Appleshaw.
