Therefore, flooding of low lying land and roads is expected to continue today, 4/11/24, especially in the Bourton on the Water and Newbridge areas. \n\nThe forecast today is cloudy but dry, and the weather should remain dry over the next few days. We expect river levels to continue falling, but levels remain sensitive to rainfall. Avoid using low lying footpaths near local watercourses. We are monitoring the situation. Go to the 'River and Sea levels in England' webpage for current river levels. This message will be updated by tomorrow morning, 5/11/24, or as the situation changes. ",
