For 2 hours either side of high water, the tide could cause flooding to boatyards and the industrial areas along Littlehampton Rope Walk. Water will be high up slipways and could be forced up through drains causing minor flooding to roads. If the tide is slightly higher than forecast, following flood damage in April 2024, it could be possible for a small amount of water to flow through The Shipyard, and onto Rope Walk. Sunday's early morning tide at 01:45 20/10/2024 is forecast to be 4 cm lower (3.22 mAOD). Similar flood impacts are expected to continue until Monday 21/10/2024.
