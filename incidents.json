The lake level is forecast to remain above the Flood Alert threshold until later this afternoon, 02/10/2022. Flooding could affect locations near the Upper River Derwent, Stonethwaite Beck and Derwent Water, with low lying land expected to be most affected, particularly around The Upper Derwent from Seathwaite to Derwent Water. River and lake levels are forecast to begin falling, but the risk of flooding to low-lying land remains. We are clearing debris from weed screens in the area and will continue to monitor levels closely. Avoid using low lying footpaths and any bridges near local watercourses and do not attempt to walk or drive through flood water. This message will be updated by 10:00 AM on 03/10/2022, or as the situation changes.",
