At Lymington, high tide is forecast at 14:10 and 16:10 on Sunday 05/01/2025. Over high water, river levels will increase as they are unable to flow to sea. Lighter rain is forecast over the next 4 hours, which means that the river will remain high until at least this evening, before water levels fall. Property flooding is not currently expected. Further rain (up to 10mm) is forecast for tonight (05/01/2025). We will continue to monitor the forecast. Given an unsettled outlook, properties located nearest to the river should take appropriate action to ensure they can protect their property. This Flood Alert will be updated at 09:00 on 06/01/2025 or sooner, if we think property flooding will occur.  ",

In the next 30 minutes, Durley School may experience flood impacts as the Ford Lake will rise faster than the River Hamble. No property flooding is expected from the river at Bishops Waltham. At Botley, surface water flooding from the main road is possible. To aid sluice operation, high tide at Southampton is at 14:35 on 05/01/2025 with a forecast level of 2.11 mAOD (4.85 mCD). This is higher than normal. Further rain is forecast (up to 5mm) over the next 4 hours, and unsettled weather this evening. Water levels in the river are likely to remain very high for the next 6 hours. Given the forecast rainfall, over the next few hours, it is possible that a Flood Warning, for onset of property flooding from the river, will be issued for Durley and Botley. We will continue to monitor the forecast. We recommend installing flood protection at Durley School. This Flood Alert will be updated at 09:00 on 06/01/2025 or sooner if we think property flooding will occur. ",
