      "message": "This message has been issued because some minor flooding to riverside roads and footpaths is likely for the overnight tide, until Sunday 31st December. High water levels may last for a few days, until the high tides at Great Yarmouth have passed. This is due to a natural tide-locking effect where high tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth restricts the normal drainage out to sea at low tide. The Broads are also currently impacted by river flows and high groundwater levels, meaning that the tide-locking effect is taking longer to clear. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boat yards and Ferry Road in Horning. We are not currently expecting the situation to escalate, or to issue any further warning messages at this time. Take care on waterside roads and footpaths, and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger. We are monitoring the situation and will issue further messages if the situation changes. We will update this message by 12 noon tomorrow, Sunday 31st December.",
