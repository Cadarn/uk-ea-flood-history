The vast majority of that rain fell in just 3 days. At Alverstone, the level is falling (by 3cm per hour). At Sandown, the river peaked at 05:30 this morning and is now stable. It will begin to fall shortly. Today (28/07/21), flood impacts to land, cycle tracks and access paths will continue along the Yar Valley as water remains ponded and unable to drain to the river. Golf Links and Moreton Common Road will also remain flooded, but this will slowly improve as the level at Sandown reduces. Over the next 5 days, slow moving and heavy showers are forecast. For the next 6 hours at least, it should remain dry, allowing the river more time to lower. The river will be very sensitive to any additional rain, so please remain prepared for further potential impacts this week. We continue to monitor the forecast. Please avoid walking or driving through flood water. This message will be updated by 11:00 on Thursday 29/07/21.",

      "message": " Later this evening and into the early hours of 29 July the Upper River Calder and it’s feeder streams between Walsden and Brighouse could be affected by a band of heavy showers passing over the area from the west. The specific locations of these showers is subject to a high degree of uncertainty but we could see some impacts on water levels from around midnight tonight and into the early hours of tomorrow morning. The latest forecast indicates that flooding of lower lying land and ponding of water on some roads is the most likely outcome where these showers occur. At this stage, flooding of property by the river is not expected, but we will review this information as the evening progresses. Our teams in the field have been out to check key river locations for material that could block bridges and culverts to help minimise flood risk. \nThis message will be updated by 09:00 on 29/07/2021, or if the situation changes. \n",
