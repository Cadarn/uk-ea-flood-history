The weather increases tide table values by 0.4 m. The total forecast tide is 7.66 metres Chart Datum (4.01 mAOD) at Eastbourne. For 2 hours either side of high water, beach top properties at Pevensey Bay will be affected by spray, caused by the large waves. The road at Herbrand Walk may flood, and could be impassable to traffic. Thursday afternoon's tide is forecast to be 20cm higher, but with slightly smaller waves, which could generate similar impacts again. Tide levels should fall from Friday (22/10/2021). We continue to monitor the forecast. To protect property from flooding, at low tide, Pevensey Coastal Defence Ltd will maintain the condition of the shingle beach. Avoid Pevensey beach at high tide. Spray and waves will contain and scatter shingle which is dangerous. As a precaution, plan driving routes to avoid Herbrand Walk. We will update this message by 11:00 on  Thursday 21/10/2021.",
