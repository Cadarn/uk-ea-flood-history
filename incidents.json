This could lead to some overtopping or spray affecting beach front gardens at Bembridge Drive, Meath Close, The Strand and Southwood Road. Saturday lunchtime tide at 13:00 on 01/02/2025 is forecast lower at 4.81m Chart Datum (2.08 mAOD). Similar impacts to the Saturday morning tide at 01:00 on 01/02/2025 are possible.
