      "message": "Water levels in the River Blackwater remain high, but have peaked and are slowly falling after heavy rainfall overnight. The Romsey rain gauge recorded 41mm in the past 24 hours. Low lying land at Cadnam, West Wellow, Landford and Ower may be flooded. Water levels will be high around the mill building at East Wellow. The weather forecast for today (21/09/2023) is for isolated scattered showers of 10-15mm which will clear overnight. There is low confidence in the location of the showers. If they occur in the Blackwater catchment, river levels may start to rise again. Property flooding is not expected. If drier conditions persist this afternoon, river levels will continue to fall. Isolated showers are forecast tomorrow (22/09/2023) but rainfall totals are less, 7-10mm. We continue to monitor the forecast. Our operations staff will work to ensure the river is free from reported blockages. Please ensure that any pumps used to help protect property are operating. This Flood Alert will be updated by 19:00 on Thursday 21/09/2023. ",
