The forecast for a dry and sunny day means levels will continue to recede until tomorrow (Sunday) when further rain is forecast and levels will rise again for a time.  For today, Derwent Water will remain high affecting low lying areas bordering the shores of Derwent Water.  Areas most at risk are the Upper Derwent from Seathwaite to Derwent Water. We continue to monitor levels closely and are clearing debris from weed screens in the area.
