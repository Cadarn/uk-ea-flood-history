Small, flashier rivers and streams may respond to heavy rainfall. Given the unpredictable nature of thunderstorms, there is low confidence in the locations and impacts of rainfall at this point. Areas most at risk are low lying agricultural land, roads and footpaths close to small rivers and streams. Water levels could rise rapidly and potentially generate deep, fast flows. We are closely monitoring the situation. Our incident response staff are monitoring watercourses in the area.
