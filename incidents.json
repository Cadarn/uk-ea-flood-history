With springs appearing, water flowing on roads and water in basements or under floorboards of properties in East Dean, Charlton, Singleton and West Dean. Groundwater will also continue to impact the ability of the sewage network to operate. No rain is currently forecast in the week ahead, and settled weather could continue until 23/01/2023.

Flooding is affecting Hundred Foot Washes, also known as the Ouse Washes, including the causeways Welney and possibly Sutton Gault. River levels are falling on the Hundred Foot Washes. \n\nThe gauge at Sutton Gault has a fault. River levels will have fallen since 05/01/23 when the causeway at Sutton Gault had approximately 17 centimetres of water on the road. The causeway at Welney has approximately 5 centimetres of water on the road, this information is correct as of 3pm on 09/01/23. Due to the uneven surface of the roads, water may be deeper in places. There are currently no issues on the Earith causeway. The Environment Agency are liaising with Norfolk Highways, who will decide when to open Welney Causeway, and Cambridgeshire Highways, who will decide when to open Sutton Gault Causeway.",

No rain is currently forecast in the week ahead. Settled weather could continue until 23/01/2023. However, groundwater will continue to rise and groundwater flood impacts will likely increase over the coming week, maybe the next fortnight. By 23/01/2023, groundwater levels could be only a few metres below the peak of February 2014. With groundwater now so high, and little capacity in the soil, the next time it rains, even more water could flow along the roads. We will continue to monitor levels and forecasts.
