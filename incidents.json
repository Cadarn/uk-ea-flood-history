Flooding will affect parts of Chandlers Ford, in particular at Stoneham Way from Chestnut Way to the M27, and parts of the recreational ground at Fleming Park. Further heavy rain will continue into the afternoon. If levels continue to rise rapidly, in the next few hours we may issue a Flood Warning for onset of property flooding from the river. Our operational staff will keep the river free of blockages in Chandlers Ford and Eastleigh. Residents should remain vigilant, especially in Chandlers Ford, where debris screens in rivers block quickly. Please report blockages to our incident hotline on 0800 807060. If you live near the river, please take appropriate action to be able to protect property. This Flood Alert will be updated at 19:00 on 18/06/2021 or sooner, if we think property flooding will occur.",

For 1.5 hours either side of high water, the incoming tide will prevent the river from flowing to the sea. This may cause the river to flood the access road and affect the car park near to the White Swan Pub at Mansbridge. Footpath flooding may also affect Riverside Park. Flow in the river will remain high and may increase after high tide. This means that flood impacts could also occur over the next high tide forecast at 06:43 and 07:45 on 19/06/2021. We continue to monitor the forecast and will remove reported blockages from the river. We recommend closing the defence gates around the pub at least an hour before high tide.
