Through Tuesday, flooding will continue to affect fields, roads and gardens, including North Street, Willows Car Park, River Lane, The Old Clergy House and Deans Place Hotel, Alfriston. The Cuckmere River through Hellingly has already fallen significantly. The Bull River through Hellingly remains higher than normal, with flood impacts likely affecting fields and roads. A small amount of rain (5mm) could be possible Tuesday afternoon, but this should not cause river levels to rise significantly. Only isolated showers are forecast for the rest of the week. Flood impacts in Hellingly should ease by Tuesday afternoon. In Alfriston, flood impacts could continue until Wednesday afternoon. However, another area of low pressure is forecast this weekend, which could cause flood risk to return. Plan to avoid routes vulnerable to flooding, including Mill Lane and Church Road Hellingly and North Street Alfriston. We continue to monitor the levels and forecast. We will update this message by 11:00 02/10/2024",
