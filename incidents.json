Minor groundwater flood impacts are expected to continue, with springs affecting fields and water on roads including Stoughton main road and large volumes of water on the road from East Marden. Groundwater will affect a small number of properties close to the village green Stoughton. Groundwater could affect basements or be near the ground floor of properties in Walderton too. Bands of rain Thursday and Friday 01/03/2024 could bring another 10-20mm of rain. With persistent showers possible Friday afternoon and Saturday. Another band of rain is forecast Monday 04/03/2024. Groundwater is expected to continue rising through to 09/03/2024 at the Compton borehole. Groundwater will remain higher than normal and sensitive to any rainfall throughout March and possibly April. If you have pumps to help reduce groundwater levels in your property, ensure they are operational. We continue to monitor the levels and forecast. We will update this message by 18:00 06/03/2024",
