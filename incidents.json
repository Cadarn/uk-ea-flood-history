      "message": "Stormy conditions are forecast, resulting in large waves moving down the East Coast of England on the morning of Friday 20th September. This will lead to unusually high tidal levels along the Wash and tidal areas of the River Welland and the River Nene. The time and date of the forecast high water is 08:45 on 20th September 2024, however conditions may apply two to four hours either side of the high tide. The high tides combined with strong winds may result in wind-blown spray and wave splash causing localised pooling of water behind the sea defences. Low lying coastal land and roads will be affected first. Our forecasts indicate that flooding to properties isn't likely and therefore flood warnings are not expected to be issued. We are constantly monitoring tide levels, and have staff in the field checking our defences and closing tidal gates where required. Please avoid using low lying coastal footpaths near beaches or promenades and plan driving routes to avoid low lying roads, as sea spray and waves could be dangerous. This message will be updated as the situation changes.",
