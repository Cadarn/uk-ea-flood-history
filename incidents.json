      "message": " River and lake levels on the River Greta, River Derwent, Derwent Water lake still remain high following rainfall last weekend and Tuesday, though the levels are dropping. Areas most at risk include low lying areas bordering the shores of Derwent Water and the frontage of the Keswick Camping and Caravan Club Site. Flooding is expected to continue to affect low lying areas here through today, Wednesday 19/07/2023. The forecast is for today to be largely dry and so the level of Derwent Water should fall below this alert trigger level. However, water draining from the land into the lake from Tuesdayâ€™s rain may result in the level remaining relatively high. Avoid using low lying footpaths and any bridges near local watercourses and do not attempt to walk or drive through flood water. This message will be updated by 10:00 AM on 20/07/2023, or as the situation changes.\n\n\n",
