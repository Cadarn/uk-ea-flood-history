Flooding may continue to affect fields near Shripney Lane and the A259, the car park at Tesco and Riverside Caravan Centre and Rowan Park Caravan Park. The next five days are currently predicted to remain dry and will allow the river level to fall further. Flood impacts should continue to ease, however, river levels could remain higher than normal through to next week. Through Shripney and Bersted minor flood impacts may still continue. River levels will remain sensitive to future rainfall. Please plan to avoid driving through routes vulnerable to flooding, including Shripney Lane. We continue to routinely clear grilles through Barnham, including at the Trading Post and our pumps at Felpham are running to reduce flood risk. We will re-issue this message if the risk of flooding to properties increases.",
