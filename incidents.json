Times of high water will vary along the coast. However, conditions may apply two hours either side of the high tide. Expect tides to be up to 130mm higher than predicted due to weather conditions.\n\nOn Wednesday, force 6 south to south-westerly winds and wave heights of up to 3m are forecast to cause overtopping of sea defences and sea spray in exposed coastal locations. Locations particularly at risk include Fowey, Polperro, Looe and Seaton.\n\nCoastal conditions should ease for Thursday morning's high tide. However, we will continue to monitor the situation and issue an update by midday on Wednesday 10th April.\n\nDetailed tidal information for those who use it; The forecast high tide level at Looe on Wednesday morning is 2.93 mAOD and on Wednesday evening is 2.77 mAOD, 0.13 metres above astronomical tide level.",

Flooding is possible today, Tuesday 09/04/24 between between 5PM and 8PM, and again Wednesday 10/04/24 between 6.30PM and 8PM. Areas most at risk include the North Sea coast from Skipsea to Mappleton, including Hornsea. Flooding of coastal roads and footpaths along coast frontages is likely.

The weather increases tide table values by 0.29 m. The total forecast tide is 4.79 metres Chart Datum (2.20 mAOD) at Cowes. For 1 hour either side of high water, very minor impact flooding will affect some sea front roads, esplanades and car parks across the island. Water will be high up slipways in Cowes, affecting Medina Road and the floating bridge. In East Cowes, sea water forced up through drains may cause very minor impacts to the road at Albany Road. At 12:45 on Wednesday 10/04/24‚ the tide level remains elevated. Currently It is unlikely that it will cause flooding to property‚ but we may issue further advice.  We continue to monitor the forecast. At Medina Road, near the Floating Bridge, the tide may rise to be only 0.1m below the top of front door steps. As a precautionary measure, and if you have it, we recommend that flood protection is installed at Medina Road 1 hour before high tide. We will update this message by 18:00 on 10/04/2024.",

Water could flow through ditches and over fields towards Littlehampton. Wednesday's afternoon tide at 13:30 on 10/04/2024 is forecast to be very similar (3.31 mAOD). Flood impacts are expected again. Flood impacts could continue until Friday 12/04/2024. We continue to monitor the forecast and routinely check the condition of the beach at Climping. Access could be restricted during and after high tide. Take care if visiting Climping beach. We will update this message by 18:00 on 10/04/2024.",
