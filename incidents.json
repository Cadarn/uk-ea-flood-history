For 1 hour either side of high water, very minor impact flooding will affect some sea front roads, esplanades and car parks across the island. Water will be high up slipways in Cowes, affecting Medina Road and the floating bridge. In East Cowes, sea water forced up through drains may cause very minor impacts to the road at Albany Road. The tide level will remain elevated until Saturday (26/11/2022). This may cause further impacts at each high water. We continue to monitor the forecast. At Medina Road, near the Floating Bridge, the tide may rise to be only 0.1m below the top of front doorsteps.

The weather increases tide table values by 0.22 m. The total forecast tide is 5.20 metres Chart Datum (2.47 mAOD) at Portsmouth. For 1 hour either side of high water, in Old Portsmouth, the tide may just exceed the top of the main slipway which will cause minor road flooding in East Street. It could also cause minor disruption to the boat yards at The Camber. Spray overtopping of defence walls at Southsea promenade and Eastern Road is also expected. To protect property in Old Portsmouth, tidal defence gates will be closed. The tide level will remain elevated until Saturday (26/11/2022). This may cause further impacts at each high water. We continue to monitor the forecast. We are liaising with the local authority over flood defence gate closures. Avoid walking along the exposed sea front, especially Southsea, at high tide. Spray and large waves can carry and throw shingle and debris. We will update this message by 15:00 on 24/11/2022.",
