Minor groundwater flood impacts are expected to continue, affecting the ability of the sewage network to operate in East Dean, Charlton, Singleton and West Dean. Water will affect some basements, and be underneath ground floors. Small amounts of water will affect roads, including the B2141 to Chilgrove. Cumulatively, between half a month's and a month's rainfall is forecast in bands of rain each evening Tuesday to Thursday, with showers at other times and unsettled weather next week. If as much rain falls as predicted, groundwater could rise a small amount, falling again by 09/04/2024. If less rain occurs, groundwater will still remain close to the surface. Minor flood impacts affecting the sewage network could continue through to May. If you have pumps to help reduce groundwater levels in your property, ensure they are operational.

Surface water flooding in roads affecting Chandlers Ford and at Stoneham Way to Chestnut Way to the M27 is possible. The heaviest rain has now cleared the area. Levels will remain high for the next 2 hours, but should begin to fall in the early hours of Monday (01/04/2024). Property flooding is not currently expected. Our operational staff will keep the river free of reported blockages in Chandlers Ford and Eastleigh. We continue to monitor the forecast. Residents should remain vigilant, especially in Chandlers Ford, where culverts and debris screens in the river can block quickly. Please report blockages to our incident hotline on 0800 807060. Given that the situation should improve, we will remove this Flood Alert by 10:00 on Monday 01/04/2024.",
