Areas most at risk are low-lying agricultural land and roads including Goose Moor Lane at Ordsall, and farmlands in the Gamston and Eaton areas.   \n\nFurther light rainfall is forecast over the next 24 hours. We expect river levels to remain high until later this evening, 23/05/21. We are closely monitoring the situation.  \n\nPlease avoid using low-lying footpaths near local watercourses and plan driving routes to avoid low-lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded.  \nThis message will be updated tomorrow morning, 24/05/21, or as the situation changes.\n",
