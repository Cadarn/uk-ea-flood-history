In Lymington, the water level is rising, with high tide at 07:30 and 19:45 compounding the river’s ability to drain to sea. Land, drainage ditches, roads, watersplashes and gardens through the New Forest will remain flooded throughout the course of Friday (08/12/23). Today the weather remains fairly dry and the water level will continue to fall. From the early hours of Saturday morning (09/12/23), further heavy rain is forecast with up to 20mm expected. Flood impacts will continue throughout the weekend, with property flooding at heightened risk. We are monitoring the situation very closely. The river is flowing rapidly and watersplashes will be deep. Please do not drive through floodwater and ensure you can take action to protect property over the next 36 hours.

Minor flood impacts might also occur near Lumley Mill, Victoria Terrace and Brook Meadows, Emsworth. The River Ems is expected to rise 20cm in total.

Further showers are possible Sunday through to Wednesday 13/12/2023, which could cause small additional rises in river level. The river will be sensitive to any additional rainfall over the rest of winter. Flood protection products are recommended to be installed in Westbourne and Emsworth, if you have them.
