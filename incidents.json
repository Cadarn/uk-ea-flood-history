      "message": "The water level in the lower River Meon at Titchfield is high and slowly rising. Overnight, 30mm of rain has been recorded at World’s End, a significant amount in a short period of time. Today (Monday 01/04/2024) out of bank flooding will continue to impact fields at Titchfield Hill with high water levels at Titchfield Mill, Bridge Cottage and the Tanneries Industrial Estate. While groundwater and river levels are currently so high, any intense rainfall events are now likely to cause surface water flooding in Titchfield High Street. Unsettled conditions and further showers are forecast over the next 5 days meaning river levels are likely to remain high for the next week, before water levels begin to fall. Our operational staff will manage water levels in Titchfield Canal and will keep the river clear of reported blockages. We continue to monitor the forecast. If you live next to the river in Titchfield, please consider taking appropriate action to protect property, installing flood protection if you have it. This Flood Alert will be updated or removed by 18:00 on Tuesday 02/04/2024.\n",

Water levels will be higher than usual due to the impact of a series of high tides and a minor surge, which has caused a natural tide locking effect. High tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth, is currently restricting the normal drainage out to sea at low tide, of the Broads river system. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boat yards and Ferry Road in Horning.   We are not currently expecting the situation to escalate, or to issue any further warning messages at this time. Take care on waterside roads and footpaths, and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger. We are monitoring the situation and not expecting the situation to escalate.  We will update this message by 11am tomorrow, Wednesday 3 April, or as the situation changes.",
