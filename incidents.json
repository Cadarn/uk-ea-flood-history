      "message": "The water level in the Danes Stream remains high, following heavy rainfall (35mm) yesterday (Thursday 07/12/23). Milford Dam has operated correctly to reduce the amount of water flowing to Milford on Sea. However, the water level in the village will remain high throughout the course of today (Friday 08/12/23) and some footpath flooding and garden flooding is likely to affect Milford on Sea High Street. High tide at Lymington is forecast at 07:30 and 19:45 and this will also act to reduce the river’s ability to drain to sea. Today, the weather remains dry. From midnight on Saturday (09/12/23) further heavy rain is forecast with up to 20mm expected. If this impacts the river, then water levels will remain consistently high until Sunday (10/12/23). We continue to monitor the forecast. Please keep away from riverside footpaths in Milford on Sea, especially at Milford Bridge opposite Lucerne Road. If footpaths are flooded it will be difficult to see where the edge of the main river channel is. This Flood Alert will be updated by 17:00 on Saturday 09/12/2023.",
