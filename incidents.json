We expect flooding to affect The Temporary Flood Barriers along the Wharfage which are now in operation and have water against them. The Environment Agency will continue to carry out maintenance activities. The deployment of the barriers does not remove all risk, as the barrier system is a temporary structure.  Predicted Peak:- Buildwas  5.4m to 5.8m this evening   Flood water could be deep and fast flowing, and therefore pose a risk to life. \n\nNo further rainfall is forecast.  We expect river levels to rise until this evening 09/12/24. \n\nWe are closely monitoring the situation.  Our incident response staff are checking defences and liaising with emergency services and or Local Authorities.   \n\nPlease avoid contact with flood water.   \n\nThis message will be updated by Tuesday morning 10/12/24, or as the situation changes.
