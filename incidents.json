River levels are forecast to rise on the Thames as a result of high tides in combination with high flows from upstream due to heavy rainfall at the weekend. The next high tide is expected at Thames Ditton Island at 12:45 this afternoon (27/11/24) and is forecast to reach between 5.54 and 5.84m, therefore flooding of low lying land and roads is possible. The high tide after this is expected at 01:15 tomorrow morning (28/11/24) and is forecast to reach between 5.61m and 5.91m, therefore flooding of low lying land and roads is expected. The following high tide is expected at 13:30 tomorrow afternoon (28/11/24) and is forecast to reach between 5.52m and 5.82m, therefore flooding of low lying land and roads is possible from this tide.\nThe forecast is for a predominantly dry afternoon and day tomorrow. We are monitoring the situation. Go to the 'River and Sea levels in England' webpage for current river levels. This message will be updated tomorrow morning, 28/11/2024, or as the situation changes.
