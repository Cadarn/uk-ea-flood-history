This means that the minor watercourses from Heighington to Dunston are now rising, which will lead to flooding of low-lying land and roads close to the river from the evening of Tuesday 13th February onwards. We expect the river to remain high throughout the next few days and flooding to gardens, driveways or outhouses is possible close to the river. Our forecasts indicate that flooding inside properties isn't likely and therefore flood warnings are not expected to be issued. We are constantly monitoring river levels and have staff in the field checking for blockages and clearing weedscreens. Please avoid using low lying footpaths near local watercourses and plan driving routes to avoid low lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded.
