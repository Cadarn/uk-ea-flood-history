      "message": "The water level in the Eastern Yar remains very high. In July, 162mm of rain has been recorded at Knighton. This is the highest total for July since records began in 1952. The vast majority of that rain fell in just 3 days. At Alverstone, the level is falling (by 3cm per hour). At Sandown, the river peaked at 05:30 this morning and is now stable. It will begin to fall shortly. Today (28/07/21), flood impacts to land, cycle tracks and access paths will continue along the Yar Valley as water remains ponded and unable to drain to the river. Golf Links and Moreton Common Road will also remain flooded, but this will slowly improve as the level at Sandown reduces. Over the next 5 days, slow moving and heavy showers are forecast. For the next 6 hours at least, it should remain dry, allowing the river more time to lower. The river will be very sensitive to any additional rain, so please remain prepared for further potential impacts this week. We continue to monitor the forecast. Please avoid walking or driving through flood water. This message will be updated by 11:00 on Thursday 29/07/21.",
