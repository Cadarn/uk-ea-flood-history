Minor groundwater flood impacts will likely continue through to mid March, with springs affecting fields and small amounts of water on roads including Stoughton main road and the road from East Marden. Groundwater could affect a small number of properties close to the village green Stoughton and possibly basements or near the ground floor of properties in Walderton too. Very little rain is forecast Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, but rain Wednesday 21/02/2024, could cause groundwater to rise higher. Groundwater could rise in communities through to 26/02/2024, but not quite as high as it has been previously this winter. Groundwater will remain higher than normal and sensitive to any rainfall over winter. If you have pumps to help reduce groundwater levels in your property, ensure they are operational. We continue to monitor the levels and forecast. We will update this message by 18:00 23/02/2024",
