For reference the peak level in January was 139.64.\n\nThe weather over the next two weeks will continue unsettled with a band of rain expected early next week and another by next weekend. These will bring periods of light to moderate rainfall. This will maintain groundwater levels at their current position for several days. There is a hint that a blocking high pressure system will become established to the east of the country bringing some respite as more settled weather develops.\n\nProperty flooding is expected and sewage systems may become inundated.\n\nResidents should deploy any property resilience measures such as pumps, flood barriers and air brick covers.\nAvoid driving through flood water as the bow wave from vehicles can flood adjacent properties.\n\nDo not lift manhole covers to alleviate local surface water flooding as this may cause toilets further downhill to surcharge.\nThis message will be updated on Sunday or as the situation changes",
