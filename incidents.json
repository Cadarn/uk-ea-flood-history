The River Test will be flowing in Deane and Ashe. Groundwater will be affecting the ability of septic tanks to operate effectively. From today 20/01/2025 until Friday 24/01/2025, only small amounts of rainfall are forecast. Unsettled weather is expected to return over the weekend and into next week with some of this rain possibly being heavy. Groundwater levels may begin to peak within the next week but if heavy rain affects the area, levels will continue to rise well into February. In Deane, it is possible that cellar flooding could occur by the end of January. We continue to monitor the forecast.
