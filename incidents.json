Areas most at risk include Christchurch Harbour and tidal stretches of the Lower Stour and Avon.  The first peak high water level at Christchurch Harbour is at 9:45 PM on 07/04/2024 with a level of 1.27 mAOD with southwesterly force 4 winds. The second peak high water level is at 10:00 AM on 08/04/2024, with a level of 1.36 mAOD with easterly force 4 winds. (mAOD is height above average sea level - for more info refer to local tide tables.) We are expecting higher than normal tides over the next few days and as a result we may issue further alerts and warnings. Sea spray overtopping along the coast is possible and high water levels in the harbour are forecast. Flooding to roads and low lying land is possible and conditions can apply one to two hours either side of high tide. We are closely monitoring the situation and our incident response staff will be closing flood gates if necessary. This message will be updated by 4:00 PM on 08/04/2024, or as the situation changes.",

Rain has now cleared away, and only isolated showers are forecast Friday, over the weekend, and Monday and Tuesday. Groundwater should begin to fall in most boreholes by 10/04/2024, but maybe not until mid April in East Dean. Groundwater will remain close to the surface. Minor flood impacts affecting the sewage network could continue through to mid May. If you have pumps to help reduce groundwater levels in your property, ensure they are operational. We continue to monitor the levels and forecast. We will update this message by 18:00 09/04/2024",

The time and date of the forecast high water is 18:45 on 08 April 2024, however conditions may apply two to four hours either side of the high tide. The high tides combined with strong winds may result in wind-blown spray and wave splash may cause localised pooling of water behind the sea defences. Low lying coastal land and roads such as the A1077 will be affected first, the A1077 road will be closed and flood gate will be in place. There is no through traffic on the A1077 between the junction of Ermine Street and Sluice Road to South Ferriby. Our forecasts indicate that property flooding isn’t likely and therefore flood warnings are not expected to be issued. Please avoid using low lying coastal footpaths near beaches or promenades and plan driving routes to avoid low lying roads, as sea spray and waves could be dangerous.
