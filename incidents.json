The weather increases tide table values by 0.22 m. The total forecast tide is 5.20 metres Chart Datum (2.47 mAOD) at Portsmouth. For 1 hour either side of high water, the main road at Northney will flood. Property flooding is not expected. At South Hayling, large waves will move or could remove shingle.

This may cause further impacts at each high water. We continue to monitor the forecast. We are liaising with the local authority and their response teams, over the condition of the beach at South Hayling. The beach condition is currently good. Avoid South Hayling seafront at high tide. Shingle and debris can be thrown by strong winds and large waves. We will update this message by 15:00 on 24/11/2022.",
