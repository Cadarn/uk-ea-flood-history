Since midnight, 7mm of rain has been recorded at Wroxall. 15mm has been recorded at Knighton.  Out of bank flooding affecting gardens, roads (Golf Links Road) and access tracks (at Horringford) will continue overnight. Whilst property is not currently affected, further rain and showers are forecast this evening and throughout tomorrow (08/11/22) with up to 20mm expected. If heavy rain does impact the river during this time, then levels will increase, and could be higher than the peak water level recorded in the early hours of this morning.  This could cause property flooding in Alverstone. We continue to monitor the forecast and will ensure the river is kept free of reported blockages.

Water will be close to the tops of the banks near Houghton Bridge, Amberley and may approach riverside properties, including near St Edmunds Cottage, Houghton. In Arundel, only minimal flood impacts are currently expected. Very little rain is forecast, but the river will continue to respond to the rainfall of recent days. The river has slowed in its rise, but could climb a little higher over the high tide period midday Tuesday. River levels will not return nearer to normal until next week.
