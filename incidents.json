For 2 hours either side of high tide, small amounts of water will flood land and fields at Climping. Waves will overtop the sea front, directing water westwards along Mill Lane (from the right of the East car park) towards properties on Climping Street. Water may pond near property and in Climping Street Car Park. Monday's afternoon tide at 14:45 21/10/2024 is forecast to be 3 cm higher (2.75 mAOD). With tides forecast to be lower as the week progresses, no further flood impacts are expected from Tuesday onwards. We continue to monitor the forecast and routinely check the condition of the beach at Climping. Avoid walking at the sea front or parking at Climping Street Car Park.
