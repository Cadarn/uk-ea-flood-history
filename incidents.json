The higher water levels will begin tonight, Wednesday 19th January, and the flood alert is expected to stay in force for the next few tides.  High tide at Great Yarmouth is at 22:00 tonight.  High water levels may last for a few days, until the high tides at Great Yarmouth have passed.  This is due to a natural tide locking effect.  High tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth, is currently restricting the normal drainage out to sea at low tide, of the Broads river system.
