High water levels may last for a few days, until the high tides at Great Yarmouth have passed. This is due to a natural tide-locking effect. High tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth, is currently restricting the normal drainage out to sea at low tide, of the Broads river system. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boatyards and Ferry Road in Horning. Be ready to take action to protect your property if flooding is expected. We are monitoring the situation and not expecting the situation to escalate. We will update this message by 10am tomorrow, Friday 3 December.",

River levels are beginning to drop, but will remain responsive to further rainfall. Areas most at risk are low-lying roads and riverside areas between Horsford and Crostwick on Spixworth Beck, and Corpusty, Saxthorpe, Itteringham, Ingworth, Aylsham and Burgh-next-Aylsham on the Bure. The forecast is for dry conditions today, which will allow river levels to start returning to normal. Take care on riverside footpaths, and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger. We are monitoring the situation and not expecting the situation to escalate. We will update this message by 10am tomorrow, Friday 3 December\t.",
