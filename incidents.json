This has allowed the river level at Alverstone to fall slowly after peaking at around 04:30 this morning (Friday 17/11/2023). At Sandown, the river is likely to continue rising until at least 18:00 this evening. More heavy rain is forecast. Up to 30mm could fall between 22:30 tonight (17/11/2023) and 14:30 tomorrow (18/11/2023). If the worst of this rain affects the Eastern Yar, property flooding is possible around Alverstone and Langbridge from 19:00 on Saturday (18/11/2023). At Sandown, levels will take longer to rise and impacts might be possible from approximately 08:00 on Sunday (19/11/2023). We are operating the sluice at Bembridge to manage the water level and continue to monitor the forecast. Please ensure that any pumps used to reduce water levels in gardens can operate. This Flood Alert will be updated by 15:00 on 18/11/2023.",
