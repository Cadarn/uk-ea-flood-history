Whilst the river level at Alverstone is rising slightly in response to the small amount of overnight rainfall, the Eastern Yar at Sandown continues to fall and is now below the level at which Fort Holiday Park is affected. Operation of Bembridge sluices, over the period of Neap tides, has reduced water levels within Brading Marshes and effectively managed the risk of property flooding in Brading. The current weather forecast indicates showers may affect the Eastern Yar catchment this afternoon but only small totals of rain are forecast. Tomorrow morning (21/11/22), a frontal band of rain will potentially bring up to 25mm of rain. This will be followed by showers Monday evening into Tuesday morning (22/11/22), possibly adding an additional 10mm of rain. If realised, this would likely see a Flood Alert issued for the Eastern Yar and potentially Flood Warnings covering the upper and lower Eastern Yar catchment. We will continue to monitor the river and weather forecast information. Avoid walking or driving through flood water. ",
