Very little rain is forecast for Monday evening, Tuesday and Wednesday, which should allow the Aldingbourne and Barnham Rifes to fall further. Minimal flood impacts affecting Riverside Caravan Centre and Rowan Park Caravan Park in Bersted should ease over the coming days. However as the river will fall slowly, the Aldingbourne Rife could remain higher than normal until mid December (or beyond), and river levels will remain sensitive to future rainfall. There is uncertainty in the weather forecast, particularly for Thursday 30/11/2023. While wintery showers are currently favoured, more persistent rain could be possible, which would likely cause river levels to rise again. Any period of persistent rainfall over the winter period could generate some flood risk. We are running our pumps at Felpham and keeping grilles clear to help reduce the risk of flooding.
