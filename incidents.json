Flooding of roads and some properties is expected to gradually recede by the beginning of next week.\nResidents should keep any property resilience measures such as pumps, flood barriers and air brick covers deployed as there may be a delayed response.\nDriving through flood water will be especially dangerous as temperatures will drop to below freezing at times over the next week and will cause ice to form on roads. The bow wave from vehicles can flood adjacent properties and lead to icing of pavements.\nSewage systems may remain problematic over the next few days.\nDo not lift manhole covers to alleviate local surface water flooding as this may cause toilets further downhill to surcharge.\nThis message will be updated on Saturday 13th January, or as the situation changes.\n",
