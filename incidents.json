From 08:00 on 27/11/2024, a small amount of water may also affect Bexhill Road Recreation Ground in Bulverhythe. Almost no rainfall is predicted Wednesday afternoon, through to the weekend. The river should begin to fall in Crowhurst by 15:00 on 27/11/2024, and should return to normal from 22:00 on 27/11/2024. It is thought river levels could end up a little higher than following Storm Bert. Flood protection products are recommended to be installed in Crowhurst, if you have them. We continue to monitor the levels and forecast. We will update this message by 14:00 on 27/11/2024",
