Minor groundwater flood impacts will likely continue through to late February, with springs affecting fields and small amounts of water on roads including Stoughton main road and the road from East Marden. Groundwater could affect a small number of properties close to the village green Stoughton and possibly basements or near the ground floor of properties in Walderton too. Showers are forecast Wednesday, with rain throughout much of Thursday and into Friday 09/02/2024. Over half a month's rain is forecast, between 40 and 60mm. Surface water will affect roads. Groundwater is expected to rise in communities through to mid February, but not rising as high as it has been previously this winter. Groundwater will remain higher than normal and sensitive to any rainfall over winter. If you have pumps to help reduce groundwater levels in your property, ensure they are operational.

      "message": "Over the last 24 hours we have seen heavy rainfall over the South Forty Foot catchment. This means that the South Forty Foot Drain is now rising, which will lead to flooding of low-lying land and roads close to the river from the morning of Friday 9th February 2024 onwards. We expect the river to remain high throughout the next few days and flooding to gardens, driveways or outhouses is possible close to the river. Our forecasts indicate that flooding inside properties isn't likely and therefore flood warnings are not expected to be issued. We are constantly monitoring river levels and have staff in the field checking for blockages and clearing weedscreens. Please avoid using low lying footpaths near local watercourses and plan driving routes to avoid low lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded. This message will be updated online and on FloodLine by 17:00 on 10/02/2024, or before if the situation changes. ",
