This Flood Alert will remain in force for the next few days due to sustained high water levels caused by the natural tide locking effect in the Broads. High tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth is restricting the normal drainage out to sea at low tide, of the Broads river system. Also, overtopping of the railway embankment at Haddiscoe New Cut has caused a reduction in the flood alert threshold. The Environment Agency and Network Rail are currently on site and working to resolve the issue. We expect to see high water levels in Brundall and Reedham riverside areas. Take care on waterside roads and footpaths, and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger. We are monitoring the situation and not expecting the situation to escalate.
