The next high tide is expected at Trowlock Island this afternoon, 04/03/25, at 5.30 pm, and is forecast to reach between 4.79 and 4.93 metres. Therefore, the river could overtop banks and flood low lying land. The following high tide is expected tomorrow morning, 05/03/25, at 05:45 am and is forecast to reach between 4.81 and 4.95 metres. Therefore, the river could overtop banks again and flood low lying land. We expect river levels to remain high over the next few days. Avoid using low lying footpaths near local watercourses. Go to the 'River and Sea levels in England' webpage for current river levels. This message will be updated by tomorrow morning, 05/03/25, or as the situation changes. ",

From Wednesday (05/03/2025), cellar flooding is expected in Kimpton. Surface water flood risk in Thruxton will increase during this week. From today (03/03/2025) until Friday (07/03/2025), the weather is expected to be dry. Groundwater levels are expected to continue rising for another week in response to rain recorded towards the end of February. We continue to monitor the levels and forecast. If you have pumps to help reduce water levels, please ensure that they are operating. We will update this Flood Alert by 18:00 on Monday 10/03/2025.",
