In Liss and Sheet, the Western Rother has returned to near normal. Monday is forecast to be mostly dry, but another 20mm of rain is expected on Tuesday afternoon into Wednesday morning (16/02/2022), which will cause the Western Rother to rise again, potentially peaking at similar heights seen on Sunday and today (14/02/2022). Near Fittleworth, the river could remain higher than normal until the end of the week. Please remain prepared for further periods of the river rising and minor flood risk between Liss and Fittleworth. Take precautionary action to reduce impacts.
