Very high river levels will occur from Bethersden to Staplehurst throughout Monday 26 July. Further storms are forecast in Kent from mid morning, but there is low confidence on the precise location given the unpredictable nature of thunderstorms.  If further rainfall occurs over the Beult catchment, river levels are likely to increase further and flooding of low lying land and roads will be possible, particularly around Bethersden, Pluckley, Smarden and Headcorn.   \n\nWe expect river levels to remain high throughout Monday 26 July. The forecast is for heavy, localised rainfall to continue this week.\n\n Our incident response staff are actively monitoring the situation and are prepared to respond if required.  \n Please stay aware in case further warnings are issued and avoid driving through flood water.  \nThis message will be updated  this evening, Monday 26 July 2021, or as the situation changes.",
