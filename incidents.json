The higher water levels will continue through today, Thursday 6th January, and the flood alert is expected to stay in force for at least the next few days. Further high tides are expected at Great Yarmouth over the weekend which may further restrict the levels from falling. This is due to a natural tide locking effect. High tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth, is currently restricting the normal drainage out to sea at low tide, of the Broads river system. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham Boat Yards and Ferry Road in Horning. Take care on waterside roads and footpaths, and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger.
