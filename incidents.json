The Broads are also currently impacted by river flows and high groundwater levels, meaning that the tide-locking effect is taking longer to clear. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boat yards and Ferry Road in Horning.

The weather increases tide table values by 0.25 m. The total forecast tide is 6.31 metres Chart Datum (2.79 mAOD) at Newhaven. For 2 hours either side of high water, a small amount of spray overtopping will affect footpaths, sea front parking and the road at Marine Parade and the Esplanade. Wave heights and volume of spray overtopping will reduce by Monday afternoon although small amounts of spray could remain each high tide through to Thursday 04/01/2024.
