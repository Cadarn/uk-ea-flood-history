Water levels are likely to remain higher than usual for the next 24 hours. This is due to weather conditions associated with Storm Arwen. High tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth is currently restricting the normal drainage of the Broads river system out to sea at low tide. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boat yards and Ferry Road in Horning. Take care on waterside roads and footpaths and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger.
