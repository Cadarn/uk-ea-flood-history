Flooding of properties is not expected.\n\nWe believe there is a possibility of flooding for Custom House (EC3R), Narrow Street (E14), Mayflower and Angel pubs (SE16), Royal Naval College riverfront, the Almshouse Slipway at Crane Street (SE10), Bankside by the Tate Modern (SE1), and Three Mill Island (E3).\n\nAstronomical tide levels are falling. The river flow at Teddington Weir is low for this time of year at 38 cubic metres per second and is steady. We anticipate the flows to remain low for the next five days.\n\nWe are closely monitoring the situation.\n\nThis message will be updated by 10:00 on 25/02/2023, or as the situation changes. ",
