Only minor flood impacts are expected in Barnham. Only isolated showers are forecast over the next five days. The Aldingbourne and Barnham Rifes should slowly fall all week. However, through Shripney and Bersted minor flood impacts will still continue until the weekend. It will likely take a fortnight of dry weather for river levels to return nearer to normal. River levels will remain sensitive to future rainfall. Please plan to avoid driving through routes vulnerable to flooding, including Shripney Lane.
