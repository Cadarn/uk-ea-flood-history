      "message": "This message has been issued because flooding of homes and businesses is possible from 11pm this evening, Thursday 23rd November, and for at least the next 24 hours. Water levels continue to remain high in this area. The forecast tides at Gt Yarmouth will restrict the freshwater river drainage out to sea resulting in higher than normal water levels within the Broads until the current high tides pass. Areas most at risk are in Reedham, Cantley and Brundall. Roads affected include Ferry Road in Reedham, the A47 and the railway line between Reedham and Brundall. The current series of high spring tides will continue for the next few days and further warning messages may be issued. After the weekend the tides will start to fall away, allowing the freshwater river flows to drain out to sea at low tide as normal again. Be ready to take action to protect your property if flooding is expected. We are closely monitoring the situation.  We will update this message by 1pm Friday 24th November, or as the situation changes.",
