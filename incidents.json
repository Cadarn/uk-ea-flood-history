The rate of reduction is very gradual and as a result, groundwater levels will remain high for several weeks, however the risk of localised flooding affecting low-lying land, roads, and water infrastructure around the Elham Valley, Alkham and Petham is now reducing steadily. Due to the drier and somewhat warmer weather in early May, groundwater levels are reducing more steadily now and flows within the Bourne rivers in the area, in particular the Nailbourne, have declined since March, when flows had reached their peak. The forecast includes some spells of wet weather for the coming week but due to the warmer and sunnier conditions over the coming weeks, we do not expect groundwater levels to rise again.
