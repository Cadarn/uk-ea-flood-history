Water levels have dropped, but remain responsive to rainfall and tide locking.  This is due to a natural tide locking effect combined with the overnight rainfall. High tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth, is currently restricting the normal drainage out to sea at low tide, of the Broads river system. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boat yards and Ferry road in Horning.   Further rain is expected tomorrow afternoon and into the evening which could lead to river levels once again rising. Take care on waterside roads and footpaths, and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger. We are monitoring the situation and not expecting the situation to escalate.
