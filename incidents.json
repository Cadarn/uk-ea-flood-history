Over the next five days, unsettled weather is expected to affect Hampshire, with up to 40mm of rain possible during that time. The rain is currently expected to be heaviest (up to 25mm) on Thursday 28/03/2024. Groundwater levels will likely continue to fall slowly, but if the heaviest rain in the forecast affects the Meon Valley, then it possible that groundwater levels could begin rising again. If this does occur, then flood water may affect the electricity sub-station and the road at Rectory Lane, Meonstoke from next week. However, if levels fall over the next week and there is no heavy rainfall in the forecast, we will likely remove this Flood Alert. We continue to monitor the levels and forecast. Please remain prepared for further flooding impacts in the coming weeks. This Flood Alert will be updated by 18:00 on Tuesday 02/04/2024. ",
