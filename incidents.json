After this tide‚ and for the rest of the week, tide levels will begin to reduce and no further impacts are expected. We continue to monitor the forecast. Be careful if driving, parking or walking at Gosport seafront at high tide. Large waves can carry and throw shingle and debris, which will affect the main road at Stokes Bay.
