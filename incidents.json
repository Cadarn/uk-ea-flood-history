The current series of high spring tides will continue for the next few days and further warning messages may be issued.

This is more than twice the average amount expected during that period. In the last 24 hours, the groundwater level in Finchdean has increased by 30cm. From Sunday 26/11/23, the Idsworth Lavant is expected to be flowing through all villages. From Monday 27/11/23, it is possible pumps which prevent water from entering property may be required. Surface water could flood property during heavier rain events. However, there is a chance groundwater could peak below this impact level. Dry weather is forecast until Sunday 26/11/23. On Monday, up to 25mm of rain is forecast in Hampshire. If heavy rain affects the area, the groundwater level will continue to rise throughout next week. If not, then the level is expected to peak next week and water could begin receding. We are liaising with the Flood Action Group. If you use pumps to reduce water levels, please ensure that they can operate. This message will be updated by 17:00 on Thursday 30/11/23.",
