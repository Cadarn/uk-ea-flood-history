The Cuckmere River along Mill Lane, has already fallen considerably from its peak. The river through Alfriston will continue rising during Thursday. Water will be in the fields, and minor flood impacts could also affect North Street, Willows Car Park, River Lane, The Old Clergy House and Deans Place Hotel, Alfriston. Very little rain is forecast until Sunday, which will enable the river to begin to fall by 17:00 21/10/2021 in Alfriston, but river levels are likely to stay higher than normal until next week. Please plan to avoid driving through routes susceptible to flooding. We continue to monitor the levels and forecast. We will update this message by 22:00 21/10/2021",
