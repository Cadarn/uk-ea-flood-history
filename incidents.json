Currently, there will be some water ponded on fields, footpaths, access and cycle tracks adjacent to the river. While heavy showers continue to affect the mainland, very little, if no rain is forecast on the Island for the rest of the day (Monday 09/08/21). In Alverstone, the water level will continue to fall. In Sandown, the river should peak around 19:00 this evening. However, it will remain high and at a similar level, until at least 23:00, before finally lowering. The river will not affect property, but Golf Links Road may experience some minor impact flooding. Light showers are forecast tomorrow (10/08/21), with up to 5mm expected. The weather should then remain fairly dry until Friday (13/08/21). This will give the river some opportunity to recover. We continue to monitor the forecast.

Due to high fluvial flows coming down the River Crane, the Crane Tidal Gates may not be able to close to hold back the incoming tide from the River Thames. If this occurs, the incoming tide will flow up the River Crane which, when combined with the fluvial flow already in the channel, will push levels high. \nSome flooding of gardens and low lying land is expected from around 5am tomorrow morning although we do not expect any flooding to buildings. Any flooding is likely to be of short duration covering the period around high tide.    \nThis message will be updated tomorrow morning 10.08.21 or earlier if the situation changes.\n",
