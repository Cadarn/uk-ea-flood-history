Only minor flood impacts are currently predicted, affecting fields, gardens and rural roads. The Western Rother should peak by approximately midday in Liss, and in Iping around 17:00 Monday (09/08/2021) and not until the early hours of Tuesday (10/08/2021) at Lodsbridge near Selham. It is thought that river levels should stay lower than have been over the weekend, but could rise to similar levels. However, isolated showers could continue through Monday afternoon, which might cause river levels to rise again, and higher. Tuesday and the rest of the week is forecast to remain largely dry. As a precaution, please keep flood resilience measures in place Monday and Tuesday while river levels remain high and rising. We continue to monitor the levels and forecast.
