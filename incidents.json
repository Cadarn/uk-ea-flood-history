However, with no rain over the past week, groundwater is now falling by about 20cm each day at our Chilgrove borehole. Groundwater is still at the very top of our borehole in East Dean, and might not show signs of falling until next week. Groundwater flood impacts are expected to continue until at least mid February 2023. With springs appearing, water flowing on roads, and water in basements or under floorboards of properties in East Dean, Charlton, Singleton and West Dean. Groundwater will also continue to impact the ability of the sewage network to operate. No rain is currently forecast in the week ahead. Long term weather forecasting is difficult, but rain could return from mid February, which could extend or cause the return of groundwater flood impacts.
