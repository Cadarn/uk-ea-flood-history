While a relatively small amount, this follows a very wet September. From 08:00 09/10/2024 minor flooding could affect the A281 at Mock Bridge, near Shermanbury. As well as extensive water in fields, flooding could also affect gardens of properties near Mock Bridge and may begin to approach buildings Wednesday afternoon. Only scattered showers are forecast Wednesday, with very little rain expected for the rest of the week. However, the river is unlikely to begin to fall until 20:00 09/10/2024, and will not return nearer to a normal level until Thursday evening 10/10/2024. River levels could end up similar to peaks of recent weeks.
