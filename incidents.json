Therefore, flooding of roads and farmland is expected later this afternoon (2 October 2021), especially in the Lower Stratton area. Flooding of properties is not forecast at this point. Further persistent rainfall is forecast over the next 3 hours. The rate of river level rise has reduced, but further heavy rain is expected, which may result in levels rising further this afternoon before stabilising and dropping overnight.\n\nWe are closely monitoring the situation. Our incident response staff have been in the area clearing weed and trash screens. Please remain safe and aware of your local surroundings and refer to the 'River and Sea levels in England' webpage for current river levels. This message will be updated tomorrow morning, 3 October 2021, or as the situation changes.",

Flooding is likely to affect locations near the Upper River Derwent, Stonethwaite Beck and Derwentwater, with low lying land expected to be most affected, particularly around the Upper Derwent from Seathwaite and Derwentwater foreshore. Heavy showery rain is forecast throughout Saturday which will cause the rivers and Derwentwater to rise further, which may result in a Flood Warning being issued for the Keswick Campsite area. We will continue to monitor the forecast and issue a Flood Warning if necessary. Avoid using low lying footpaths and any bridges near local watercourses and do not attempt to walk or drive through flood water.
