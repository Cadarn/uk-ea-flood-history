Since the level peaked on Wednesday 25/01/2023, it has fallen by 8cm. Ongoing cellar flooding will be impacting a large number of properties on West Street and East Street. Groundwater is affecting the sewerage network and Fareham Road is currently flooded. Over the next 5 days, dry weather is expected to continue. This will allow groundwater in Hambledon to continue falling. Further unsettled weather is forecast in February 2023. However, confidence on the location and intensity of any rainfall event remains low. If heavy rain does affect Hambledon, groundwater will rise again. We are liaising with the Flood Action Group and continue to monitor the situation. If you use pumps to reduce water levels, please ensure they are operating.

Water levels are expected to gradually rise and peak around 8pm. This is due to a natural tide locking effect. High tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth, is currently restricting the normal drainage out to sea at low tide, of the Broads river system. We expect to see high water levels in Brundall and Reedham riverside areas. We are not currently expecting the situation to escalate.
