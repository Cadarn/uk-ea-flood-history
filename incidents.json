      "message": "Groundwater is high, close to the surface, but slowly falling at the Compton borehole. Minor groundwater flood impacts will likely continue, with springs affecting fields and small amounts of water on roads including Stoughton main road and the road from East Marden. Groundwater could affect a small number of properties close to the village green Stoughton and possibly basements or near the ground floor of properties in Walderton too. Other than a light, brief and isolated shower, no rain is forecast through to Friday 02/02/2024. High pressure could keep most rain away from the south throughout February, with a cooler period possible for mid February. Groundwater will continue falling this week, although will remain close to the surface, and minor flood impacts could continue through to mid February. Groundwater will remain higher than normal and sensitive to any rainfall over winter. If you have pumps to help reduce groundwater levels in your property, ensure they are operational.

We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boat yards and Ferry Road in Horning.
