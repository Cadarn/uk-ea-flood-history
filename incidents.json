      "message": "This message has been issued because some minor flooding to low lying land, roads and riverside areas is likely from now, Tuesday 10th December, and for at least the next 24 hours. River levels are still high following the recent storm rainfall. Locations most at risk are low lying roads and riverside areas between Fakenham and Dereham, and areas around Lyng, Lenwade, Attlebridge and Costessey. We are not currently expecting the situation to escalate, or to issue any further warning messages at this time. The forecast is for light rain today and then dry conditions for the rest of the week, which will allow river levels to start returning to normal. Flood water is dangerous. Don't put yourself or others at risk. We are monitoring the situation. We will update this message by 10am tomorrow, Wednesday the 11th of December, or as the situation changes.",
