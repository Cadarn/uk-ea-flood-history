From 05:00 on 30/09/2024, flooding could affect fields, rural roads and gardens of a small number of properties in Crowhurst, including on Forewood Lane and between the Plough public house and the junction of Sampsons Lane on Sandrock Hill. A small amount of water may also affect Bexhill Road Recreation Ground in Bulverhythe. After the rain clears on Monday morning, only isolated showers are forecast for the rest of the week. The river should begin to fall in Crowhurst by 14:00 on 30/09/2024, and return to normal by Tuesday morning. In Bulverhythe river levels will fall slower, and could remain higher than normal all week. River levels could end up similar to the past week, possibly higher if more rain occurs than predicted.
