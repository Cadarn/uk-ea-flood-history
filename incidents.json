Groundwater levels are above normal for this time of year and are at a level where communities may continue to be affected by groundwater flooding. Groundwater levels are steady, but the catchment remains sensitive to further rainfall due to saturated ground and high groundwater levels. Low-lying land, gardens, roads, and cellars will therefore continue to be at risk of flooding. Due to the nature of groundwater flooding, this situation could continue for several weeks or longer. Avoid driving or walking through floodwater as there may be concealed hazards. We are continuing to monitor groundwater levels and check impacts in the area.
