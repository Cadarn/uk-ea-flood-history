The total forecast tide is 6.15 meters Chart Datum (3.10 mAOD) at Littlehampton. For 2 hours either side of high tide, minimal flood impacts are expected. Waves could cause a small amount of overtopping of the beach. A small amount of water could find its way behind the beach and may pond on nearby land and fields including at Climping Street Car Park and Mill Lane.  Access could be restricted during and after high tide. Take care if visiting Climping beach. The tide levels are a little elevated over the next 2 days. Very similar conditions and flood impacts are expected on Friday's early morning tide at 01:00 10/03/2023, after which the weather improves. Where flood impacts do occurâ€š they will be very minor. We continue to monitor the forecast and routinely check the condition of the beach at Climping. We will update this message by 11:00 on 09/03/2023.",
