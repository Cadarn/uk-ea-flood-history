Tides will be at their highest at Beadnell Harbour Road North between 13:45 and 17:30, and at Newbiggin Bay North Promenade between 14:30 and 17:30, today, 01/02/22. Flooding to roads and farmland is possible at these times, however adverse conditions may apply two to four hours either side of the high tide which is at 15:30.  Areas most at risk are seaside footpaths and low lying land and roads.   \nWe are closely monitoring the situation.  \nPlease be careful along beaches, promenades, coastal footpaths and roads. Stay away from large waves and sea spray as they can be dangerous. \nThis message will be updated by 19:00 on 01/02/22, or as the situation changes.\n",
