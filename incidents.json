Dry weather is expected from Wednesday (20/12/2023) to Saturday (23/12/2023). Groundwater is expected to continue rising. Minor impact flooding to Hensting Lane could occur from early next week. We continue to monitor the forecast. If you use pumps to help reduce water levels, please ensure that they can operate. This Flood Alert will be updated by 17:00 on Friday 22/12/2023.",
