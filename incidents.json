Areas that could be affected include: Tilshead, Orcheston, Shrewton and Berwick St James. The groundwater level at the Tilshead borehole has risen to 97.3m, and is expected to rise further early next week due to rainfall over the weekend, with around 17-50mm expected to fall over 3 days.\n\nResidents are advised to prepare property resilience measures over the weekend and ensure that pumps are working where they have been installed. Residents may experience inundation of septic tanks and sewer systems. Properties may experience flooding in cellars in affected areas.\n\nFlooding of roads is expected, take particular care when driving, both for your own safety and to prevent flooding to others. Roads may have become damaged by floodwater.\n\nWhere groundwater is near the surface, intense rainfall will lead to surface water flooding. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.\n\nThis message will be updated by 3:00 PM on 28/01/2025.",
