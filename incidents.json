High tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth, is currently restricting the normal drainage out to sea at low tide, of the Broads river system. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boatyards and Ferry Road in Horning.

Please avoid using low lying footpaths near local watercourses.  \nThis message will be updated by 11:00 on Monday, 08/11/21, or as the situation changes.\n",

This will lead to unusually high tidal levels along the South Humber Bank between Barton Upon Humber to Humberston. The time and date of the forecast high water is 19:00 on 7th November 2021, however conditions may apply two to four hours either side of the high tide. The high tides combined with strong winds may result in wind-blown spray and wave splash causing localised pooling of water behind the sea defences.  Low lying coastal land and roads will be affected first.  Our forecasts indicate that flooding to properties isn't likely and therefore flood warnings are not expected to be issued. We are constantly monitoring tide levels, and have staff in the field checking our defences and closing tidal gates where required. Please avoid using low lying coastal footpaths near beaches or promenades and plan driving routes to avoid low lying roads, as sea spray and waves could be dangerous. This message will be updated as the situation changes.  \n",
