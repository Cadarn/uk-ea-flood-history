Groundwater levels are above normal for this time of year and have now reached a level where communities may be affected within the next few days by flooding from groundwater.\n\nWe expect levels to continue to rise over the next few weeks in response to rainfall forecast across the area. Low-lying land and roads will therefore continue to be at risk of flooding. Due to the nature of groundwater behaviour, this situation could continue for several weeks or longer.\n\nWe are continuing to monitor groundwater levels and will update this message tomorrow, 27/11/2023, or as the situation changes.",
