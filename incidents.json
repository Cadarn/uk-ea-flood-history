Property flooding is not currently expected. Only a very small amount of rain is expected to affect Hampshire during Monday (06/01/2025) and Tuesday (07/01/2025).

Water will be extensive through fields and will affect gardens and properties on Lower Street and Swan Corner, Pulborough, near to Swan Bridge and Bridge Cottages, Greatham. Only scattered showers are forecast Monday and Tuesday. The river should begin to fall a little quicker by 19:00 06/01/2025, once the tide turns and flows out to sea. Flood risk should reduce by Tuesday evening, but river levels will not return nearer to normal until the weekend. Another 10-20mm of rain is forecast on Wednesday and again on Friday, which will slow the fall, and could cause a small river rise and flood risk to increase. Some roads, including the A29 at Pulborough, may be affected by flood water, please plan to avoid driving through routes vulnerable to flooding. Our pumps in Pulborough are running to help reduce the risk of flooding. We will update this message by 15:00 07/01/2025.",
