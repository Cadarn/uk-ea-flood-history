As of today, Thursday 4th April, the weather forecast indicates further periods of rainfall over the next few days before becoming drier over the weekend and into next week. We are monitoring the situation and are working with local authorities and communities with the deployment of temporary defences, such as Canterbury City Councilâ€™s temporary defences in Barham and the Littlebourne Flood Relief channel. Our staff are maintaining and clearing key structures. Groundwater levels are expected to remain high into Spring 2024. This message will be updated by Friday 12th April 2024, or as the situation changes. Search 'Kent Groundwater situation' on gov.uk.",
