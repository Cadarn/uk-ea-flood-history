This message has been issued pre-emptively ahead of localised thunderstorms between 10:00 on 22/06/23 until  21:00 on 22/06/23.  Given the unpredictable nature of thunderstorms, there is low confidence in the locations and impacts of rainfall at this point.  Areas most at risk are low lying agricultural land, roads and footpaths close to small rivers and streams.  Water levels could rise rapidly and potentially generate deep, fast flows.   \nThunderstorms are forecast over the next 12 hours, with low confidence over exact timing and locations.  \nWe are closely monitoring the situation.  \n  \nThis message will be updated ",
