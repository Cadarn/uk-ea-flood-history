From 09/12/2023 minor groundwater flood impacts are possible, with springs appearing, water flowing on roads, water in basements or under floorboards, and affecting the ability of the sewage network to operate in East Dean, Charlton, Singleton and West Dean. A further 20mm of rain is possible Saturday 09/12/2023. Only small amounts of rain are currently forecast Friday, Sunday and next week. Groundwater is expected to continue rising until 15/12/2023 at Chilgrove and until the New Year at East Dean. If the second half of December is dry, groundwater flood impacts might ease in January. However, groundwater will remain higher than normal and sensitive to any additional rainfall over winter. If you have pumps to help reduce groundwater levels in your property, ensure they are operational. We continue to monitor the levels and forecast. We will update this message by 18:00 13/12/2023.",

A further 5-10mm is now more likely on the island. Whilst this will cause a rise in water level today and there will be a continuation of flooding affecting land, access, cycle tracks, footpaths, gardens and roads (Moreton Common), it is unlikely to flood property. The tidal range at Bembridge has now improved and is allowing more water to drain to sea at each high water. The weather outlook to Saturday looks fairly dry, so the river will lower over the next 5 days. A Flood Alert will remain in force.  ",
