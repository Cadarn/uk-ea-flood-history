We will continue to monitor the forecast and issue a Flood Warning if necessary.\nAvoid using low lying footpaths and any bridges near local watercourses and do not attempt to walk or drive through flood water.\nThis message will be updated by 10:00 AM on 02/10/2021, or as the situation changes.\n",
