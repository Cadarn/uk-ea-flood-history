This level is being maintained by water being pumped off the moor.\nThe pumping station drain level is 8.05m and falling steadily in response to pumping activities. Flooding will affect the road from Langport to Muchelney if this level exceeds 7.30m, from Muchelney to Long Load above 7.86m, and from Muchelney to Thorney above 7.93m. Property flooding is expected when this level exceeds 8.35m. \nBlustery conditions and occasional showers sometimes with strong winds are forecast for the rest of the week.\nWe are currently pumping at Westover and Huish Episcopi pumping stations and will continue to clear as much water from the moors as river levels allow. Please remain mindful of local water levels and do not attempt to drive, cycle or walk through flood water.\nPlease refer to @TravelSomerset for information on closed roads.\nThis message will be updated by 1pm on Friday 22/12/23, or as the situation changes.\n\n",

In the last 24 hours, the groundwater level at our borehole in West Meon Hut has increased by 17cm. In the next 4 days, cellar flooding will begin to affect a small number of cellars in Cheriton. It is unlikely that cellar flooding will affect property in Bramdean for another few weeks. Today (Tuesday 19/12/2023), up to 13mm of rain is forecast in Hampshire. Dry weather is expected from Wednesday (20/12/2023) to Saturday (23/12/2023). Groundwater is expected to continue rising. Septic tanks could struggle to operate effectively from early next week. We continue to monitor the forecast. If you use pumps to help reduce water levels, please ensure that they can operate. This Flood Alert will be updated by 17:00 on Friday 22/12/2023.",

In response to this groundwater level increase, communities in and around the Elham Valley (Nailbourne), Alkham and Petham may experience impacts from high groundwater. Due to the nature of groundwater levels, other communities across East Kent may also experience increased impact from high groundwater. The Environment Agency is continually monitoring the situation and we are co-ordinating efforts with local authorities and community leaders. Our incident response staff are attending weedscreens and culverts regularly to clear them.\n\nWe are issuing this message to allow our communities and partners to act as appropriate.\n \nThis event may continue for the foreseeable future and until the end of the recharge season, typically in Spring 2024.
