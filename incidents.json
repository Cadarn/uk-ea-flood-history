Consequently, the risk of flooding to roads and farmland remains. Flooding is affecting low-lying land and roads adjacent to the Bourne Brook.   \nFurther scattered showers are forecast over the next 24 hours.\nWe are closely monitoring the situation. Our incident response staff are actively checking river levels and the weather forecast.  \nPlease avoid using low lying footpaths and bridges near local watercourses and plan driving routes to avoid low lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded.  \nThis message will be updated tomorrow morning, 10/05/21, or as the situation changes.",
