This combined with rainfall is likely to increase levels further. Levels are likely to remain high through today Saturday 8th January and into tomorrow. Water levels are expected to continue to rise gradually over the next few hours. This is due to a natural tide locking effect combined with today's rainfall. High tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth, is currently restricting the normal drainage out to sea at low tide, of the Broads river system. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boat yards and Ferry road in Horning. Take care on waterside roads and footpaths, and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger. We are monitoring the situation and not expecting the situation to escalate. We will update this message by 10am tomorrow, Sunday 9th January.\t",
