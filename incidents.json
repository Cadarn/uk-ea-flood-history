The Thames Barrier is has closed for the next high tide this afternoon so the Flood Alert threshold will not be met this afternoon. However the Thames Barrier is due to re-open this evening and therefore for the next high tide at 3am 25/02/2024 the river is expected to overtop banks and flood low lying land. The predicted height of the tide is between 5.15 and 5.45 metres. Avoid using low lying footpaths near local watercourses. Go to the 'River and Sea levels in England' webpage for current river levels. This message will be updated tomorrow, 25/02/24, or as the situation changes.",

The river will be out of bank in some locations, possibly flooding gardens and the Millennium Water Meadows at Wickham. Showers are forecast today (Saturday 24/02/24). This additional rainfall will maintain the responsive nature of the River Meon catchment. A further, potentially significant (up to 35mm), band of rain is forecast on Sunday (25/02/24) into Monday (26/02/24). We will continue to monitor the forecast and will ensure the river remains free of any reported blockages. Residents who have low lying property near to the river should remain prepared for flooding. Any pumps used for high groundwater levels should be checked to ensure they can be operated. This Flood Alert will be updated by 15:00 on 25/02/24 or sooner if required.",
