At The Sadlers in Westhampnett, the river will be high, but should remain lower than it has been over the past week. River flooding should not affect Chichester City Centre. The weekend will remain dry, however 15-20mm of rain is possible on Tuesday 19/12/2023. This could cause river levels to rise again and could potentially cause some minor flood impacts. The river will remain sensitive to any additional rainfall over the rest of winter. If you see a blockage affecting the flow in the river, please call our incident hotline on 0800 80 70 60.
