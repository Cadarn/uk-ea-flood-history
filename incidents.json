Groundwater is flooding the main road into Penton Grafton and is emerging into Deacon and Down Road, Kimpton. Impacts to the sewerage systems in Penton Mewsey and Appleshaw are ongoing.

If the heavier rain in the forecast affects the area, then groundwater levels will rise and cellar flooding in Kimpton and surface water flood risk in Thruxton could occur in the next 2 weeks.
