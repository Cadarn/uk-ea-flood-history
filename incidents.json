Water levels are likely to remain higher than usual for the next few days. This is due to weather conditions associated with Storm Arwen. High tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth is currently restricting the normal drainage of the Broads river system out to sea at low tide. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boat yards and Ferry Road in Horning. Take care on waterside roads and footpaths and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger. We are monitoring the situation and not expecting the situation to escalate. We will update this message by 10:00am tomorrow, Sunday 28th November. ",
