The drain level at Currymoor pumping station is 6.91m. Pumping will start at Currymoor Station as soon as the river level allows. \nDrier weather is forecast for Thursday and into the weekend although showers are likely to return on Sunday. We continue to monitor the situation, clearing weed screens and checking rivers for blockages. Don't put yourself or others at risk. Refer to https://www.somerset.gov.uk/roads-travel-and-parking/emergency-road-closure-gates/ for details of road closures.

Flood impacts affecting the A29 at Pulborough, fields, gardens near Swan Bridge Pulborough and Bridge Cottages, Greatham, should reduce a little through Friday. Only isolated showers are forecast Friday and Saturday. The river should continue to slowly fall, but will not fall nearer to a normal level until the middle of next week. On Sunday 01/12/2024, another 10-20mm of rain is forecast, which could cause the river to rise again, although we currently think not as high. However, minor flood impacts could still be possible. Some roads, including the A29 at Pulborough, may be affected by flooding, please take care if driving on routes vulnerable to flooding. Our pumps in Pulborough are running to help reduce the risk of flooding. We will re-issue this Flood Warning if new instances of property flooding become expected.",
