A combination of the third highest spring tides of the year, along with high fluvial flows will result in high water levels. We are expecting higher than normal tides up to and including the morning tide of the 11th of March.\nAreas most at risk include Christchurch Harbour and tidal stretches of the Lower Stour and Avon.  Sea spray overtopping along the coast is possible and high water levels in the harbour are forecast. Flooding to roads and low lying land is possible, and conditions can apply one to two hours either side of high tide. We are closely monitoring the situation and our incident response staff will be closing flood gates if necessary. Please be careful along beaches, promenades, coastal footpaths and roads. Avoid using low lying footpaths near local watercourses.\nThis message will be updated by 4:00PM on 09/03/2024, or as the situation changes.\n",

Following months of wet weather, minor flood impacts will affect land, gardens and isolated properties in communities along the Bourne Rivulet, including Upton, Ibthorpe, Stoke and St Mary Bourne.

During periods of rainfall over the weekend, the river could rise by 5-10cm. Flood depths could increase on land, gardens and roads, including parts of the B3048. Surface water will be unable to drain to the river effectively. If the maximum rain falls, a small number of properties directly on the main road or next to the river could be affected by minor flood impacts from Sunday 10/03/2024.
