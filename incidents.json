Water levels continue to remain high. This is due to a natural tide locking effect. High tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth, is currently restricting the normal drainage out to sea at low tide, of the Broads river system. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boat yards and Ferry road in Horning. Be ready to take action to protect your property, if flooding is expected. We are monitoring the situation and are not expecting the situation to escalate. We will update this message by 10am tomorrow, Saturday 4th December 2021.\t\n",

The weather increases tide table values by 0.02 m. The total forecast tide is 6.00 metres Chart Datum (2.95 mAOD) at Littlehampton. For 2 hours either side of high tide, minimal flood impacts are expected. A small amount of water could find its way behind the beach and may pond on nearby land and fields including at Climping Street Car Park and Mill Lane. Friday evening's tide at 22:30 03/12/2021 is forecast to be 10cm higher, but accompanied by lighter winds and smaller waves. Saturday morning's tide at 10:45 04/12/2021 is forecast to be the highest of the week (3.19 mAOD) and again accompanied by strong winds. We continue to monitor the forecast. We recycled shingle in November and routinely check the condition of the beach at Climping. Shingle and debris can be thrown by large waves. Access could be restricted during and after high tide.
