Scattered showers are possible during Tuesday, but the rest of the week is forecast to stay largely dry. The river should begin to fall by 22:00 Tuesday 05/10/2021, returning to near normal Wednesday afternoon. Flood impacts should begin to slowly ease when river levels start to fall. Some roads, including those mentioned in this message, may be affected by flood water. Please plan to avoid driving through routes vulnerable to flooding. We continue to monitor the levels and forecast, and will issue a flood warning if confidence in property flooding increases. We will update this message by 11:00 Tuesday 05/10/2021.",
