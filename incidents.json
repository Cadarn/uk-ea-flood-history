This is more than twice the average rainfall expected during that time. In the last 24 hours, the groundwater level at Whitedale Farm has risen by 20cm. From Sunday night (26/11/2023), levels may be high enough to affect a small number of cellars in Lower West Street, however the groundwater level may peak just before this occurs. The weather until Sunday is forecast to be dry. On Monday (27/11/2023) up to 25mm of rain is forecast in Hampshire. If heavy rain affects Hambledon, the groundwater level will continue to rise throughout next week. If not, then the level is expected to peak early next week and water could then recede from cellars in Lower West Street. We will continue to monitor the forecast. We are liaising with Hambledon Flood Action Group. Please remove any valuables from cellars, and if you use pumps to help reduce water levels, please ensure that they can operate. This Flood Alert will be updated by 17:00 on Wednesday 29/11/2023.",
