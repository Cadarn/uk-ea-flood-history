Small, flashier rivers and streams may respond to heavy rainfall as a result of localised thunderstorms passing through the area from 12:00 today.  Given the unpredictable nature of thunderstorms, there is low confidence in the locations and impacts of rainfall at this point. \n \nAreas most at risk are low lying agricultural land, roads and footpaths close to small rivers and streams.  Water levels could rise rapidly and potentially generate deep, fast flows.  \n \nThunderstorms are forecast over the next 12 hours, with low confidence over exact timing and locations.\n \nWe are closely monitoring the situation.  Our incident response staff are patrolling watercourses in the area. \n \nPlease stay aware in case further alerts or warnings are issued and plan driving routes to avoid low-lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded. \n \nThis message will be updated daily at 11:00, or as the situation changes.",

      "message": "The River Ouse is high and rising. Almost a month's rain (57mm) has been recorded at Ardingly, on Monday. From 20:00 (06/05/2024) flooding is expected to affect the Anchor Inn, near Barcombe. Flood water will be extensive through fields. Barcombe Mills Road and Anchor Lane are likely to be impassable. From 23:00 (06/05/2024) flood water could begin to approach isolated properties at Barcombe Mills. Rain has now cleared the area, and high pressure, bringing settled dry weather, is forecast for the next five days. The river should begin to fall by 13:00 (07/05/2024), but may not return nearer to normal until 17:00 Wednesday (08/05/2024). River levels could end up similar to those seen in January or February 2024. Some roads may become impassable. Please plan to avoid driving through routes vulnerable to flooding, including Barcombe Mills Road. Flood protection products are recommended to be installed in Barcombe, if you have them. We are operating our structures in Barcombe to help keep the river flowing freely and reduce flood risk. We will update this message by 14:00 on 07/05/2024.",
