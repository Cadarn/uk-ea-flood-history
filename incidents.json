Therefore, flooding of low lying roads and farmland is expected to continue, especially in the Longbridge Mill area. No significant further rainfall is expected today 09/07/21. River levels have peaked, but still pose a flood risk and remain sensitive to further rainfall. We are closely monitoring the situation. Please remain safe and aware of your local surroundings and refer to the 'River and Sea levels in England' webpage for current river levels. This message will be updated this evening, 09/07/21, or as the situation changes.",
