As levels are now below the flood risk threshold this flood alert is no longer in force.\n\nThere may be further rain overnight and through tomorrow, 1/10/22, however this will be localised and much lighter and is not expected to cause a significant rise in river levels. \n\nWe will continue to monitor levels closely.
