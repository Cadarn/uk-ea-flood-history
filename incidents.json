      "message": "The tide on Wednesday lunchtime will be higher than normal due to unsettled conditions, increasing the river levels in the Lower River Itchen at Mansbridge. The Southampton high tide at 12:00 on Wednesday 26/10/2022 is forecast at 5.22 metres Chart Datum (2.48 mAOD). For 1.5 hours either side of high water, the incoming tide will prevent the river from flowing to sea. This may cause the river to flood the access road and affect the car park near to the White Swan Pub at Mansbridge. Footpath flooding may also affect Riverside Park. With only light rain forecast and reducing tide levels, further impacts are not expected. We recommend closing the defence gates around the White Swan pub at least an hour before high tide. We will monitor the situation and open the sea door at Woodmill on Wednesday morning to help lower river levels. Given that the situation is expected to improve, we will remove this Flood Alert by 18:00 on 26/10/2022.",
