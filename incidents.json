Water will affect some basements, and be underneath ground floors. Water will appear on, flow on, and collect on roads, including the B2141 near Chilgrove. Scattered showers are forecast Friday and Saturday. Persistent rain is forecast Sunday and Monday 26/02/2024. Groundwater is expected to rise higher. Groundwater could rise in communities through to March, potentially as high as it has been previously this winter. Groundwater will remain close to the surface, and minor flood impacts affecting the sewage network could continue through to April. Groundwater will remain higher than normal and sensitive to any additional rainfall into spring. If you have pumps to help reduce groundwater levels in your property, ensure they are operational. We continue to monitor the levels and forecast. We will update this message by 18:00 27/02/2024",
