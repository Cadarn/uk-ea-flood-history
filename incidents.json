Groundwater levels are above normal for this time of year and have now reached a level where communities may be affected within the next few days by flooding from groundwater.\n\nGroundwater levels in the area are slowly rising and responsive to rainfall. The forecast is for a predominantly dry night tonight (04/01/2023) and day tomorrow with the possibility of heavy showers. We expect levels to continue rising over the next few days. Low-lying land and roads will therefore continue to be at risk of flooding.
