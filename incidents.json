The weather increases tide table values by 0.54 m. The total forecast tide is 5.37 metres Chart Datum (2.64 mAOD) at Portsmouth. For 1 hour either side of high water, the main road at Northney will flood. At South Hayling, shingle and debris may be thrown by strong winds and large waves. This may cause garden and road flooding at Southwood Road, Bembridge Drive, Meath Close and The Strand. At 00:47 on Thursday (03/08/2023)‚ the tide level remains elevated but will be lower than at Wednesday lunchtime. Currently it is unlikely that it will cause flooding to property‚ but we may issue further advice tomorrow (02/08/2023). We are liaising with the local authority over the condition of the beach at South Hayling. At high tide, water may be higher up the beach than normal. Drop boards will be installed along the promenade. Avoid South Hayling seafront at high tide. We will update this message by 18:00 on 02/08/2023. ",
