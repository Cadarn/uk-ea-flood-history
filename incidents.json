      "message": "Groundwater levels in Salisbury Plain remain high. Areas that could be affected include: Winterbourne Gunner, Winterbourne Dauntsey, Winterbourne Earls and Laverstock . The groundwater level at the Queen Manor Farm and Clarendon boreholes are expected to remain high. We are expecting some further rainfall in the coming days, although with low daily totals. We are not currently expecting very much drop in the groundwater levels. Residents are advised to prepare property resilience measures and ensure that pumps are working where they have been installed. Residents may experience inundation of septic tanks and sewer systems. Properties may experience flooding in cellars in affected areas. Flooding of roads is expected, take particular care when driving, both for your own safety and to prevent flooding to others. Roads may have become damaged by floodwater. Where groundwater is near the surface, intense rainfall will lead to surface water flooding. We will continue to monitor the situation closely. This message will be updated by 12:00 PM on 25/02/2025. ",
