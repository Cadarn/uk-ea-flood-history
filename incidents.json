Water levels continue to remain high, but are starting to reduce to more normal levels.  These high water levels are due to a natural tide locking effect. High tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth, is currently restricting the normal drainage out to sea at low tide, of the Broads river system. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boat yards and Ferry road in Horning.  We are not currently expecting the situation to escalate, or to issue any further warning messages at this time. Take care on waterside roads and footpaths, and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger. We will continue to monitor the situation. We will update this message by 9am tomorrow, Monday 25th October.
