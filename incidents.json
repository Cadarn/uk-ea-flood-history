      "message": "River levels are rising due to heavy rain showers currently being experienced across South London.  Flooding is expected imminently this evening, Monday 12 July. Flooding to land nearest the rivers in the area is probable, particularly low-lying land, roads and gardens in the Worcester Park and New Malden areas where river levels are rising rapidly. Not all areas are seeing the heaviest rain, flooding is only expected to affect the areas that do see heavy showers this afternoon and evening. Surface water flooding may also be experienced during this time. This unsettled forecast will continue into the evening, with the likelihood that river levels will fluctuate in response to further rain, with some flooding remaining possible. We are closely monitoring the situation and will issue Flood Warnings if required. Our staff are in the area checking our defences and structures.  Please avoid contact with flood water and stay aware of your situation locally. This message will be updated by 9pm today, or as the situation changes.",
