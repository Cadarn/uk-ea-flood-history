      "message": "Sunday afternoon's tide at 14:00 on 20/10/2024 is higher than normal due to unsettled weather with strong South Westerly Force 6 winds. The weather increases tide table values by 0.25 m. The total forecast tide is 6.38 metres Chart Datum (3.33 mAOD) at Littlehampton. For 2 hours either side of high water, the tide could cause flooding to boatyards and the industrial areas along Littlehampton Rope Walk. Water will be high up slipways and could be forced up through drains causing minor flooding to roads. If the tide is slightly higher than forecast, following flood damage in April 2024, it could be possible for a small amount of water to flow through The Shipyard, and onto Rope Walk. Monday's early morning tide at 02:15 21/10/2024 is forecast to be 58 cm lower (2.75 mAOD). With tides next week forecast to be lower, no further flood impacts are expected from Monday onwards. We continue to monitor the forecast. If you have it, please install flood protection 2 hours before high tide. We will update this message by 19:00 on 20/10/2024.",

      "message": "Over the last 24 hours we have seen heavy rainfall in the River Rase area. This means that the River Rase is now rising, which will lead to flooding of low-lying land and roads close to the river from the afternoon of Saturday 19/10/2024 onwards. The A631 road at Bishopbridge is expected to be affected by flood water, resulting in some impact on public safety. The Environment Agency recommends that you do not drive through flood water. We expect the river to remain high throughout the next few days and flooding to gardens, driveways or outhouses is possible close to the river. Our forecasts indicate that flooding inside properties isn't likely and therefore flood warnings are not expected to be issued. We are constantly monitoring river levels and have staff in the field checking for blockages and clearing weedscreens. Please avoid using low lying footpaths near local watercourses and plan driving routes to avoid low lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded. This message will be updated online and on FloodLine by 17:00 on 20/10/24, or before if the situation changes.",
