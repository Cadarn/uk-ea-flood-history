Winds are light Westerly Force 3. The weather increases tide table values by 0.1 m. The total forecast tide is 6.01 metres Chart Datum (2.96 mAOD) at Littlehampton. For 2 hours either side of high tide, minor flood impacts are expected. A small amount of water could find its way behind the beach and may pond on nearby land and fields including at Climping Street Car Park and Mill Lane. Saturday's midday tide will be very similar and minor impacts should be expected again. We continue to monitor the forecast and routinely check the condition of the beach at Climping. In order to reduce flood risk to property, our operations staff have moved shingle to try and improve the beach crest. Shingle and debris can be thrown by large waves. Access could be restricted during and after high tide. Take care if visiting Climping beach. We will update this message by 10:00 on 26/11/2022.",
