This will maintain groundwater levels at their current position for some days to come. \n\nProperty flooding is expected and sewage systems may become inundated.\n\nResidents should deploy any property resilience measures such as pumps, flood barriers and air brick covers now.\nAvoid driving through flood water as the bow wave from vehicles can flood adjacent properties.\n\nDo not lift manhole covers to alleviate local surface water flooding as this may cause toilets further downhill to surcharge.\nThis message will be updated on Wednesday 28th February, or as the situation changes.",
