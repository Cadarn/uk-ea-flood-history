While uncertainty remains around exact timings and which areas will experience the heaviest rain, if this occurs in the Hendon, Wembley, Harrow, Wealdstone, Edgware or Stanmore areas there is a possibility that rivers could respond quickly and overtop their banks. Flooding to low lying land, roads and riverside gardens is possible. Surface water flooding may also affect low lying areas.\n \nWe recommend that you monitor local weather conditions and avoid walking, cycling or driving through flood water. \n\nWe are monitoring the situation closely and have staff out on the ground checking and clearing trash screens. \n\nWe will update this message by 9am tomorrow, Saturday 24 July 2021 or earlier if the situation changes.\n",
