A small amount of water may pond on nearby land and fields including at Climping Street Car Park and Mill Lane. Waves could cause overtopping of the beach.

Wednesday morning's tide at 11:15 on 29/01/2025 is forecast to be 12 cm lower (2.59 mAOD). From Wednesday tide levels will increase towards a peak on Sunday.

      "message": "The water level in the River Lymington at Brockenhurst remains higher than normal but is slowly falling. In the last 24 hours, just 3mm of rain has been recorded at Brockenhurst. This has allowed the river a chance to recover. Residual flooding impacts affecting land and roads are expected to reduce throughout this evening and into tomorrow morning (29/01/2025). However, tomorrow afternoon (29/01/2025), further rainfall is expected to affect Hampshire. There is a possibility that this could be heavy, bringing up to 35mm of rainfall. If heavy rain affects the Lymington River, then flooding to land and roads, including Burley Road, Brockenhurst will increase. The river could be very high through Martin’s Road and Balmer Lawn Road, where garden flooding is a possibility. We continue to monitor the forecast and will ensure the river remains free of reported blockages. Please avoid driving through watersplashes as water may be deep. This Flood Alert will be updated by 18:00 on Wednesday 29/01/2025.",
