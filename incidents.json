      "message": "This message has been issued because some minor flooding to riverside roads and footpaths is possible through the rest of this afternoon and evening, Monday 8th November, due to recent tide locking and continued elevated water levels.  High water levels may last for a few days, until the high tides at Great Yarmouth have passed. This is due to a natural tide locking effect. High tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth, is currently restricting the normal drainage out to sea at low tide, of the Broads river system. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boat yards and Ferry road in Horning. Take care on waterside roads and footpaths, and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger. We are monitoring the situation and not expecting the situation to escalate.  We will update this message by 10:00am tomorrow, Tuesday 9th November. ",
