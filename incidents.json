Further showers are expected from 06:00 06/09/2024, which could cause river levels to rise again. Therefore this flood alert will remain in force. There remains uncertainty in the locations, and expected amounts of rainfall. If totals are near the maximums predicted, then flood impacts could be possible. Any river rise and flooding will likely occur quickly following intense downpours. Flooding could affect a small number of commercial properties on Bridge Road and residential properties on West Common Road. Odd numbered properties from 29 to 47 on Meadow Drive could be affected by flooding. If you see a blockage affecting the flow in the river on Bridge Road or Hickmans Lane, please call our incident hotline on 0800 80 70 60. We routinely clear debris from grilles through Lindfield, including the Builders Centre and Witch Inn, to help keep the river flowing freely and reduce flood risk. We will update this message by 11:00 06/09/2024.",
