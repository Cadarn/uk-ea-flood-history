This means that the River Nene is now rising, which will lead to flooding of low-lying land and roads close to the river from this morning, Sunday 24th November onwards. We expect the river to remain high throughout the next few days and flooding to gardens, driveways or outhouses is possible close to the river. Our forecasts indicate that flooding inside properties isn't likely and therefore flood warnings are not expected to be issued.

Our incident response staff were out checking defences and clearing screens on Saturday and will be back out this morning. We also continue to actively check river levels and the weather forecast. \nPlease avoid contact with flood water and call 999 if in immediate danger.  \nThis message will be updated by 17:00 on 24/11/24, or as the situation changes.\n",
