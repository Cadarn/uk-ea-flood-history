At our borehole in Oakley, levels have risen by 10cm since Saturday (17/02/2024). We expect properties in Deane to be experiencing cellar flooding. Groundwater spring-flows are impacting land and roads. Septic tanks are struggling to operate effectively. There is potential for further rainfall on Wednesday (21/02/2024) and Thursday (22/02/2024), with up to 30mm of rain forecast in Hampshire across these two days. If heavy rain continues to affect the area over the next couple of weeks, it is possible that the access road from the B3400 into Deane (at Deane Park) will need to be closed before the end of February. We continue to monitor the forecast. If you have pumps to help reduce water levels, please ensure that they are operating. This Flood Alert will be updated by 18:00 on Tuesday (27/02/2024).",
