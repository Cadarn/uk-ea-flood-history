Given the unpredictable nature of thunderstorms, there is low confidence in the locations and impacts of rainfall at this point. Areas most at risk are low lying agricultural land, roads and footpaths close to small rivers and streams. Water levels could rise rapidly and potentially generate deep, fast flows. Thunderstorms are forecast this morning through to this evening, with low confidence over exact timing and locations. We are closely monitoring the situation.Please plan driving routes to avoid low-lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded and see the GOV.UK website for a 5 day flood forecast.  \nThis message will be updated this evening 08/07/23, or as the situation changes.\n",
