The Broads are also currently impacted by river flows and high groundwater levels, meaning that the tide-locking effect is taking longer to clear. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boat yards and Ferry Road in Horning.

Over the last week we have seen heavy rain fall across Devon, and further spells of rain, which may be heavy in places are expected on Monday evening and overnight. This means that river levels in the Exmoor Rivers area will rise, and will remain high for the next couple of days, as heavy rain is falling on already wet catchments. Levels suggest that there will be flooding to low lying land and roads close to the river. More heavy rain accompanied by very windy conditions on Tuesday will cause river levels to rise again. Take care near the areas of concern and monitor your local weather conditions. We are monitoring river levels and have staff in the area checking for and clearing blockages.
