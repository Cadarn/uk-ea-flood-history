From midnight tonight, the level in the river may just begin to come out of bank and may cause minor impact flooding to the road at Rectory Road, nearest the railway line at West Dean. Rain caused by Storm Bert will continue until the early hours of Sunday morning (24/11/24). There will then be a temporary respite, before a further 20-30mm is expected. In response to the rainfall recorded today, the river may continue to rise until at least midnight. Our operations staff are ensuring the River Dun is free of blockages. We continue to monitor the forecast. At West Dean, we recommend moving any cars which are parked close to the river for, if not overnight, then tomorrow, when more significant road flooding is expected. This Flood Alert will be updated by 12:00 on 24/11/24.",
