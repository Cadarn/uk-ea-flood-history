Consequently, flooding of roads and farmland is possible between 02:45 tomorrow, 27/07/2023 and 02:15, 28/07/2023.  Areas most at risk are low-lying agricultural land and roads including Slash Lane at Sileby and the Mountsorrel to Sileby road.   \n We expect river levels to rise until 11:30 on 27/07/2023.\n\nWe are closely monitoring the situation.  Our incident response staff are patrolling watercourses in the area.  \n\nPlease plan driving routes to avoid low-lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded and avoid using low-lying footpaths near local watercourses.  \nThis message will be updated by 09:00 on 27/07/2023, or as the situation changes.",
