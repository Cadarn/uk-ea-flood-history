The causeway at Welney has approximately 5 centimetres of water on the road, this information is correct as of 3pm on 09/01/23. Due to the uneven surface of the roads, water may be deeper in places.

If very heavy rain does affect the area, surface water impacts to properties and roads are possible from the weekend (Saturday 14/01/2023), and groundwater may affect more cellars and the sewage network.
