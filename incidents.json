      "message": "This message has been issued because some flooding to riverside roads and footpaths is likely. Water levels will continue to rise today, Monday 31st January, with levels expected to peak this evening. The peak is expected to be of a similar height to that of Sunday morning's tide.  High water levels may last for a few days, until the high tides at Great Yarmouth have passed. This is due to a natural tide locking effect. High tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth, is currently restricting the normal drainage out to sea at low tide, of the Broads river system. Areas most at risk are in St Olaves, Somerleyton, Burgh St Peter, Oulton Broad and Beccles. Roads likely to be affected include Beccles Road at St Olaves, Geldeston Lock Lane, Gillingham Dam and Fen Lane in Beccles.  Take care on waterside roads and footpaths, and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger. We are monitoring the situation and will update this message by 10am tomorrow, Tuesday 1st February. ",
