Consider putting your flood plan into action. You should avoid walking, cycling or driving through flood water.\nWe will continue to monitor river levels and check watercourses for blockages.\nRainfall amounts are expected to be less on Friday (17/03/23) which should allow river levels to recede.\nThis message will be updated by 10:00 AM on Thursday (16/03/2023), or as the situation changes\n",
