No further flood impacts are expected Thursday afternoon and over the next five days, although large waves are forecast to return at the weekend. We continue to monitor the forecast. At low tide we will check and work to maintain the condition of the shingle beach which helps to protect the town from flooding. Please take care if visiting Seaford Sea Front at high tide.

For 2 hours either side of high water, spray overtopping will affect Marine Parade and the Esplanade at Seaford sea front. It is possible that water will flow beyond the sea front, and towards roads near the junction of Steyne Road and Fitzgerald Avenue. Thursday afternoon's tide at 12:30 02/01/2025 is forecast to be 22 cm lower (3.13 mAOD). No further flood impacts are expected. We continue to monitor the forecast. At low tide we will check and work to maintain the condition of the shingle beach which helps to protect the town from flooding. Avoid Seaford sea front at high tide.
