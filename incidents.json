Minor groundwater flood impacts will likely continue through to late February, with springs affecting fields and small amounts of water on roads including Stoughton main road and the road from East Marden. Groundwater could affect a small number of properties close to the village green Stoughton and possibly basements or near the ground floor of properties in Walderton too.
