Water levels continue to remain high, but are expected to soon start to drop back down to more normal levels. This is due to a natural tide-locking effect where high tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth restricts the normal drainage out to sea at low tide. The Broads are also impacted by river flows and high groundwater levels, meaning that the tide-locking effect is taking longer to clear. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boat yards and Ferry Road in Horning. We are not currently expecting the situation to escalate, or to issue any further warning messages at this time. Take care on waterside roads and footpaths, and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger. We are monitoring the situation and will issue further messages if the situation changes.
