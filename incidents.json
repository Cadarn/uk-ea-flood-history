The weather forecast is for largely dry conditions today, Saturday 11th November, and also for the morning of Sunday 12th November.  However, frontal rain is forecast to bring widespread rain through Sunday evening and overnight into Monday with some of this potentially being heavy.  Flood water is dangerous.
