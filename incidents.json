Our incident room is open and we are closely monitoring the situation. Consider putting your flood plan into action. Avoid using low-lying footpaths and any bridges near local watercourses, and do not attempt to walk or drive through flood water.

Parts of Riverside Park will also be flooded. Levels will also be very high at Gaters Mill. Rain has now cleared the area, and dry weather is forecast for the next 5 days. After the next high tide, river flows will slowly reduce and flooding impacts will improve. However, there remains a risk of flooding at each high tide over the next couple of days.
