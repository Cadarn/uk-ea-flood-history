This is about half a month’s total and is similar to the storm on 27th July. In the next couple of hours, water may begin to flow across the railway tracks, upstream of St Johns Station. Surface water may already be causing impacts as drains become overloaded. Property flooding is not currently expected at this time but we will keep this under review. Further thundery showers are possible this morning and over the next 24 hours. Water levels will remain very high until at least midday. Our operational staff will keep the Monktonmead Brook clear of reported blockages. Please consider moving vehicles from depots located next to the river and railway line.
