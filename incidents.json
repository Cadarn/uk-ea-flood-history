Consequently, flooding of roads and farmland is possible today, 11/01/22. We expect flooding to affect the Horner Water, Rivers Aller and Washford, and the Hawkcombe, Monksilver and Doniford Streams and tributaries. We expect river levels remain above the Flood Alert threshold throughout today, 11/01/22. We are closely monitoring the situation. Our incident response staff are clearing weed screens and closing flood gates. Please avoid using low lying footpaths near local watercourses and plan driving routes to avoid low lying roads near rivers which may be flooded and refer to local authority website for local road closures. This message will be updated by 11:00 on Wednesday, 12/01/22, or as the situation changes.",
