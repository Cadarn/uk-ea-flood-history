For 2 hours either side of high tide, minimal flood impacts are expected.

It will be bank full as it flows through Martin’s Road and Balmer Lawn Road, and may cause garden flooding at Balmer Lawn Road. In Lymington itself, the river will rise over the next 10 hours, but we do not expect impacts to property. Rain has now cleared the area and a dry afternoon follows. Tomorrow (Tuesday 01/10/2024) only a small amount of rain (10mm) is forecast. The rest of the week should remain relatively dry. The river should peak around 15:00 this afternoon, remaining high until 16:00, before it will finally reduce. We continue to monitor the forecast and ensure the river remains free of any reported blockages. Watersplashes will deepen over the next 3 hours. Do not drive through floodwater.
