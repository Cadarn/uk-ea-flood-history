Tomorrow morningâ€™s tide is not forecast to reach flood alert thresholds.

There is a possibility of high water levels for the tidal River Avon from Sea Mills to Conham in Bristol and between the Avonmouth Bridge and Shirehampton Park including Pill and Shirehampton. Flooding to roads and farmland is possible but properties are not expected to flood at this point. We are closely monitoring the situation. Our incident response staff will be on site closing flood gates. Be careful along beaches and low lying coastal footpaths and roads. This message will be updated by midday, Saturday 09/10/2021.",
