Residents are advised to prepare property resilience measures and ensure that pumps are working where they have been installed. Residents may experience inundation of septic tanks and sewer systems. Properties may experience flooding in cellars in affected areas. Flooding of roads is expected, take particular care when driving, both for your own safety and to prevent flooding to others. Roads may have become damaged by floodwater. Where groundwater is near the surface, intense rainfall will lead to surface water flooding. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.
