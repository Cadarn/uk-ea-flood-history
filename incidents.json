Rising groundwater will begin to affect Springvale Road in Kings Worthy. From Thursday 07/03/2024, in Martyr Worthy, Chilland and Easton, drainage ditches and culverts may become full and less effective as natural flow paths are restricted. Some properties may be affected as water seeps up through floors. Footpaths near the river will also become inaccessible. From today (Monday 04/03/2024) to Wednesday 06/03/2024, lighter rain (between 10 and 25mm) is forecast in Hampshire. Thursday (07/03/2024) and Friday (08/03/2024) are expected to be dry. Groundwater levels are expected to begin stabilising before the end of this week. We continue to monitor the forecast.
