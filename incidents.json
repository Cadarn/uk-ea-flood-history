At 13:30 on 20/02/2022 the weather increases tide table values by 0.05 m. The total forecast tide is 7.15 metres Chart Datum (3.50 mAOD) at Eastbourne. For 2 hours either side of high water, beach top properties at Pevensey Bay will be affected by spray, caused by the large waves and the road at Herbrand Walk may flood. Monday morning’s tide at 02:00 21/02/2022 is forecast to be 30cm higher, and with larger waves. Minor flood impacts will continue Monday. Conditions should improve Tuesday 22/02/2022. We continue to monitor the forecast. To protect property from flooding, at low tide, Pevensey Coastal Defence Ltd will maintain the condition of the shingle beach. Avoid Pevensey beach at high tide. Spray and waves will contain and scatter shingle which is dangerous. As a precaution, plan driving routes to avoid Herbrand Walk. We will update this message by 20:00 on 20/02/2022",
