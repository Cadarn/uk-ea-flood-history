Groundwater levels are above normal for this time of year and have now reached a level where communities may be affected by groundwater flooding.  We expect levels to remain high for the rest of the winter period and sensitive to further sustained periods of rainfall.  Low lying land, roads and properties will therefore continue to be at risk of flooding. We are continuing to monitor groundwater levels and will update this message next week, by 18/03/2025, or as the situation changes. ",
