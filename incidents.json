Tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth, restricts the normal drainage out to sea at low tide, of the Broads river system. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boat yards and Ferry Road in Horning.  The recent series of high spring tides has now peaked, and will fall away over the next few days, allowing the freshwater river flows to drain out to sea at low tide as normal again.
