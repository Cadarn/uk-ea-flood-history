Flooding will affect locations near the River Tone and on Currymoor, with low lying land and roads expected to be most affected. New Road and Cutts Road have been closed. The River Tone level at Currymoor pumping station remains stable at 7.47m. Water will enter Currymoor reservoir via Hookbridge spillway whilst this level exceeds 7.45m. The drain level at Currymoor pumping station is 6.87m and is very slowly rising. Pumping will start at Currymoor Station as soon as the river level allows.

Plan driving routes to avoid New Road in Currymoor, which is affected by flooding. Don't put yourself or others at risk.
