Minor groundwater flood impacts are expected to continue, with springs affecting fields and water on roads including Stoughton main road and the road from East Marden. Groundwater could affect a small number of properties close to the village green Stoughton. Groundwater could affect basements of properties in Walderton too. Cumulatively, between half a month's and a month's rainfall is forecast in bands of rain each evening Tuesday to Thursday 04/04/2024, with showers at other times and unsettled weather next week. The rate of groundwater fall will slow, and could rise a small amount, for a short period. Falling again by 09/04/2024. Even if less rain falls than predicted, groundwater will remain higher than normal and sensitive to rainfall, with minor flood impacts persisting until May.
