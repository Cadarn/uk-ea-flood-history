Flooding is likely to affect locations near the Upper River Derwent, Stonethwaite Beck and Derwentwater, with low lying land expected to be most affected, particularly around the Upper Derwent from Seathwaite and Derwentwater foreshore. Heavy showery rain is forecast throughout Saturday which will cause the rivers and Derwentwater to rise further, which may result in a Flood Warning being issued for the Keswick Campsite area. We will continue to monitor the forecast and issue a Flood Warning if necessary. Avoid using low lying footpaths and any bridges near local watercourses and do not attempt to walk or drive through flood water. This message will be updated by 10:00 AM on 03/10/2021, or as the situation changes. ",
