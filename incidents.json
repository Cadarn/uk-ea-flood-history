With hardly any rain forecast on Saturday (09/03/2024), river levels could fall a centimetre. Rain is forecast on Sunday 10/03/2024, but there is uncertainty in locations. Currently, predictions suggest most rain on Sunday should avoid the River Lavant but some rain in the early hours could still raise river levels by 5cm. Minor flood impacts could again be possible from 01:00 on Sunday 10/03/2024. Plan to avoid driving routes vulnerable to flooding, including Sheepwash Lane.

Whilst not a large total, it follows weeks of prolonged wet weather. High tide at Southampton is at 22:15 today. Tide levels are normal for a spring tide and are forecast at 4.93 mCD (2.19 mAOD) at Southampton. Tomorrow's tide at 10:15 is 4.94 mCD (2.2 mAOD). For 2 hours either side of high tide, the river will come out of bank affecting the access road and car parking areas near the White Swan Pub and car garage at Mansbridge. Parts of Riverside Park will be flooded. Levels will be very high at Gaters Mill. Further rain will affect the area over the next 24 hours with 10mm widespread, and up to 15-20mm in isolated showers. As river flows will continue to increase there is a risk of flooding on every high tide over the next two days. To help lower water levels we have operated the sluices at Woodmill. We recommend closing the defence gates around the pub at least an hour before and after high tide. This Flood Warning will be updated by 12:00 on 10/03/2024.\n",
