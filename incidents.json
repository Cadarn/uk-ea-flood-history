At Old Alresford, the level has fallen by 2cm. We expect a small number of properties in Preston Candover and Old Alresford will be pumping water out of their cellars. In Old Alresford, we expect that 1 property is experiencing internal flooding. Groundwater levels will reduce the ability of septic tanks to operate properly. Dry weather is forecast for the next 5 days. Groundwater levels are beginning to stabilise and will remain high throughout January 2024. Some properties in Preston Candover may experience internal ground floor flooding later this winter after further heavy rainfall is recorded. We continue to monitor the forecast and groundwater levels. If you use pumps to help reduce water levels, please ensure that they are operating.
