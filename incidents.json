Storm Dudley was forecast to bring strong winds, large waves and spray overtopping on the coast. This tide has now passed. However, we expect Storm Eunice to affect the coast over the next few days, and with increasing spring tides the effects are predicted to intensify. The high tide on Friday 18/02/22 midday is also expected to reach Flood Alert level, and we are likely to issue further alerts and warnings over the next 2-3 days, depending on the path of the next storm. We will continue to monitor levels closely and our incident response staff will be out checking defences and closing flood gates where necessary. Please be careful along beaches, promenades, coastal footpaths and roads as large waves and sea spray could be dangerous. We will update this message tomorrow morning 18/02/22 or as the situation changes.",

      "message": "This flood alert remains in force as levels remain high on the River Ouse, due to recent heavy rain. Flooding is expected to affect locations near the River Ouse, with low lying land most affected, particularly around Riverside footpaths and low-lying land in York and to the south as far as Naburn Lock, including Kings Staith, Queens Staith, and South Esplanade. The River Ouse in York has peaked at around 2.5m. Levels are expected to start falling during Thursday evening 17/02/2022. Further rainfall is forecast for Friday 18/02/2022 and over the weekend which may see levels rise again. We will continue to monitor levels closely. The Foss Barrier has not been operated today as levels were not high enough to require it. Avoid using low lying footpaths and any bridges near local watercourses and do not attempt to walk or drive through flood water. Plan driving routes to avoid low lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded. Visit the GOV.UK website for a 5 day flood forecast and up to date river levels.
