Flooding of low-lying roads and footpaths is expected, which may exist for one to two hours either side of high tide. Flooding of properties is not expected. We believe there is a possibility of flooding for Putney Embankment (SW15), Chiswick Mall and Strand on the Green (W4), Thames Bank at Mortlake (SW14), Ranelagh Drive (TW1), Friars Lane and Water Lane (TW9), Riverside and The Embankment at Twickenham, and the Towpath below Teddington Lock. Astronomical tide levels are rising. The river flow at Teddington Weir is low for this time of year at 20 cubic metres per second and is steady. We anticipate the flows to remain low for the next few days. We are closely monitoring the situation. This message will be updated by 09:00 on Sunday 25th July 2021, or as the situation changes.",
