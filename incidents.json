Between Liss and Midhurst, river levels are now slowly falling. Only scattered showers are forecast for Monday. The Western Rother should begin to fall by 11:00 09/01/2023, at Lodsbridge and 22:00 09/01/2022 at Fittleworth. However, very wet days are currently forecast for Tuesday and Thursday, which could bring risk of property flooding along the whole of the Western Rother. River levels might not return to normal until the week of 16/01/2023. Early actions to reduce potential impacts at Lodsbridge and Fittleworth are encouraged.

The Idsworth Lavant is flowing, and a small number of pumps will need to operate to prevent water from affecting property. Today (09/01/2023), is expected to be mostly dry. Further heavy rain is forecast during this week, with up to 25mm on Tuesday 10/01/2023, and up to 20mm possible on Thursday 12/01/2023. With the rain that has already fallen, groundwater levels in the valley are expected to continue to rise throughout this week. If very heavy rain does affect the area, surface water impacts to properties and roads are possible from the weekend (Saturday 14/01/2023), and groundwater may affect more cellars and the sewage network. With additional unsettled weather forecast for the rest of January, levels are likely to remain high or may rise even further in the coming weeks. We are liaising with the local Flood Action Group.
