Flooding is possible two hours either side of this time.\nAfter the high tide overnightâ€š tides remain higher than normal for the next two days but heights are reducing and we do not expect further flood alerts to be necessary after tonight's tide.\nWe have closed flood gates at Arnside promenade.\nBe careful along beaches, promenades, coastal footpaths and roads as large waves and sea spray could be dangerous.\nThis message will be updated by 9:00 AM on 25/07/2024, or as the situation changes.",
