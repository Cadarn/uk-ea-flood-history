      "message": "The water level in the Danes Stream is very high. In the last 13 hours, 27mm of rain has been recorded at Stem Lane. This is a significant amount in a short time. Milford Dam has operated correctly to reduce the amount of water flowing to Milford on Sea. However, the water level in the village is very high and some footpath flooding is occurring. Gardens at Milford on Sea High Street may also be affected. No impacts are expected at Ashley. Following high tide this afternoon (Sunday 05/01/2025), the level in the river should begin to reduce. We continue to monitor the forecast. Please keep away from the riverside footpaths in Milford on Sea, especially at Milford Bridge opposite Lucerne Road during Sunday 05/01/2025. If footpaths are flooded it will be difficult to see where the edge of the main river channel is. This Flood Alert will be updated at 12:00 on Monday 06/01/2025. ",
