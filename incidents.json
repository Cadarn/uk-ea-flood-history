At Alverstone and Langbridge, the river will reach a similar level to yesterday morning (and could rise a few cms higher). It will flood gardens, surround property, flood the main road at Alverstone, Golf Links and Moreton Common Road. Today and for the rest of this week, showers, which at times, will be heavy and slow moving, are forecast. Whilst most of the rain has currently cleared the area, further rain could impact the river today. At Alverstone, the river will rise until at least 14:00. At Sandown, it wonâ€™t peak until the early hours of Wednesday morning, rising to bank full at the main road bridge. We continue to monitor the forecast. At Alverstone and Langbridge, please take action to protect property. This message will be updated by 15:00 on Tuesday 27/07/21.",

This is about half a monthâ€™s total. In the next hour, water will begin to flow across the railway tracks, upstream of St Johns Station. Surface water may already be causing impacts as drains become overloaded. Property flooding is not currently expected at this time but we will keep under review. Further thundery showers are still possible over the next 24 hours. Water levels will remain very high until at least 06:00. Our operational staff will keep the Monktonmead Brook clear of reported blockages. Please consider moving vehicles from depots located next to the river and railway line. We will update this message by 11:00 27/07/2021.",
