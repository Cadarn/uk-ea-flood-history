In the last 2 weeks, 150% of the long term average monthly rainfall (95mm) has been recorded at Bishops Sutton. Isolated properties in Cheriton are being expected to be affected by cellar flooding. Septic tanks will be struggling to operate effectively. Unsettled weather is expected to affect Hampshire today 21/02/2024 and tomorrow 22/02/2024 with up to 40mm of rain possible in these two days. Another 15mm of rain is possible in Hampshire on Sunday 25/02/2024. Groundwater levels are expected to rise in response to the recent rain and if heavy or persistent rain continues to affect the area over the next couple of weeks, cellar flooding in Cheriton will continue to become deeper, and impacts to septic tanks will increase. Cellar flooding in Bramdean is not expected unless very heavy rain continues into March. We continue to monitor the levels and forecast. If you have pumps to help reduce water levels, please ensure that they are operating. This Flood Alert will be updated by 18:00 on Wednesday 28/02/2024.",

Scattered showers are forecast Friday and Saturday, which should not increase river levels significantly. River levels are starting to slowly fall, but could remain higher than normal until the middle of next week. Persistent rain is possible Sunday and Monday, which will cause the river to rise again. Some roads may become impassable, please plan to avoid driving through routes vulnerable to flooding, including Barcombe Mills Road.
