In the last 3 months, prolonged, higher than average rainfall (353mm), has been recorded in Bishops Sutton. From Friday 20/12/2024, it is possible that rising groundwater will reduce the ability of septic tanks at Old Alresford to operate properly. In Preston Candover, a small number of properties may experience cellar flooding. Unsettled weather is expected to return to Hampshire from Wednesday 18/12/2024 into Thursday 19/12/2024 with between 15 and 35mm of rain possible. Following this rainfall, groundwater levels may begin to rise more rapidly. Friday 20/12/2024 and Saturday 21/12/2024 are expected to be mostly dry. We expect groundwater levels in Preston Candover and Old Alresford will likely continue rising for most of December in response to this week’s rain. We continue to monitor the groundwater levels and weather forecast. If you use pumps to help reduce water levels, please ensure that they can operate.
