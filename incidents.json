This is in addition to an extremely wet November 2022. In the last 24 hours, the groundwater level in Finchdean has increased by 0.69m. The Idsworth Lavant is expected to begin flowing on Sunday (08/01/2023). From Monday (09/01/2023), the level may become high enough where a small number of pumps may have to operate to prevent water from affecting property. Further rain (20 to 35mm) is forecast across Saturday and Sunday 08/01/2023. Groundwater levels in the valley are expected to rise until at least mid-January. With unsettled weather forecast for the rest of January, groundwater levels in the valley are likely to remain high or could rise even further in the coming weeks. Surface water may begin to flood property during heavier rain events. We are liaising with the Flood Action Group. Please ensure any pumps you use to help reduce water levels are able to operate.
