Waves remain large, but not as large as Tuesday afternoon. Adjusting for the weather, the total tide is forecast to be 5.45 metres Chart Datum (2.40 mAOD) at Littlehampton, nearly a metre lower than Tuesday. For 2 hours either side of high tide, small amounts of water will flood land and fields at Climping beach. Waves will overtop the sea front, directing water westwards along Mill Lane towards properties on Climping Street. Water may pond near property and in Climping Street Car Park. Conditions are forecast to remain similar - generating similar minor impacts, until Friday, when winds should ease and wave heights reduce. We continue to monitor the forecast and routinely check the condition of the beach at Climping. Shingle and debris can be thrown by large waves. Access could be restricted during and after high tide. Take care if visiting Climping beach. We will update this message by 18:00 on 08/12/2021.",
