Other locations that may be affected include Llanymynech, Maesbrook and Melverley. At 9:30am today, Friday 07/01/22 the level at the Cae Howel gauge was 3.2m and rising. Further rain is forecast over the next few days and river levels are forecast to rise as a result. We are closely monitoring the situation. Predicted peaks:-  Llanymynech 3.3 to 3.7m Saturday evening 08/01/22; Cae Howel 4 to 4.4m Sunday morning, 09/01/22. Please avoid using low lying footpaths near local watercourses and plan driving routes to avoid low lying roads near rivers, which may be flooded.
