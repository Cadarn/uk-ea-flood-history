Water levels are starting to drop, however further rainfall is expected overnight and into tomorrow which is likely to cause levels to rise again. This is due to a natural tide locking effect. High tidal water moving up the rivers from Great Yarmouth is currently restricting the normal drainage out to sea at low tide of the Broads river system. We expect to see high water levels around Potter Heigham, Wroxham boat yards and Ferry road in Horning. Take care on waterside roads and footpaths, and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger.
